<p class="chapterhead">
The favour with which the English public has received the
First Edition of this translation of Bastiat’s <em class="e000I2">Harmonies
Économiques</em>, published originally in separate parts, has
induced me to have the whole reprinted in a cheaper and
more accessible form, in the hope of giving the work a
wider circulation, and rendering it more generally useful.</p>

<p>The first ten chapters were all that appeared in the lifetime
of the gifted author, or that had the benefit of his
finishing touch. It was Bastiat’s intention, had he lived,
to recast the work, and to give it a wider and more comprehensive
scope; embracing in his design not only the principles
of Political Economy, but their applications to Social
Philosophy. Prior to his departure for Italy, on what he
foresaw might be his last journey, he had communicated to
his friends MM. de Fontenay and Paillottet a list of the new
chapters in the order in which they will be found in the
subjoined Notice of his Life.<a href="#FN_1"
id="FNa_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
To the same friends, in his
last moments, he entrusted the manuscripts intended for the
continuation of the work. The duty thus committed to
them they discharged very judiciously, by arranging the
new portions in the order pointed out, without altering the
text, and, except in a very few instances, without additions
of their own, contenting themselves with adding some
explanatory notes, consisting chiefly of references to the
author’s other works. <a id="p004" class="xxpn">[p004]</a></p>

<p>Some of the chapters thus added are unfortunately mere
fragments, but most of the others indicate very clearly
Bastiat’s opinions on the subjects to which they relate, and
several of them display a breadth, a vigour, and an originality
worthy of the best days of their lamented author.</p>

<p>Many of the questions purely economical which are discussed
in the posthumous portions of the work,—such, for
instance, as those of Wages, Population, and the relations of
Labour and Capital, etc.,—are still deeply engaging public
attention in England, as well as on the other side of the
Channel; and on subjects of such vast practical importance
it is surely desirable that the opinions of so profound and
fearless a thinker as Bastiat should be as widely disseminated
as possible.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I may perhaps be permitted to refer to the
great interest taken in this translation by the late Mr
Cobden, who was the correspondent and personal friend of
Bastiat, and was, I need not say, so eminently qualified to
form and pronounce an opinion on the merits of his last
great work. A short time after the appearance of the first
ten chapters (26th March 1860), writing from Paris, where
he was then engaged in negotiating the Commercial Treaty,
Mr Cobden says, “My enthusiasm for Bastiat, founded as
much on a love of his personal qualities as on an admiration
for his genius, dates back nearly twenty years. I need not,
therefore, express any astonishment at the warmth with
which you speak of his productions. They are doing their
work silently but effectually. M. Guillaumin [the eminent
publisher] tells me the sale of the last edition has been
steady and continuous, and a new one is now in hand. The
works of Bastiat, which are selling not only in France,
but throughout Europe, are gradually teaching those who,
by their commanding talents, are capable of becoming the
teachers of others; for Bastiat speaks with the greatest
force to the highest order of intellects. At the same time,
he is almost the only political economist whose style is
brilliant and fascinating, whilst his irresistible logic is
<a id="p005" class="xxpn">[p005]</a> relieved by sallies of wit and
humour which make his
<em class="e000I2">Sophismes</em> as amusing as a novel.
No critic who has read
Bastiat will dare to apply again to Political Economy the
sarcastic epithet of the ‘dreary science.’ His fame is so
well established, that I think it would be presumptuous to do
anything to increase it by any other means than the silent
but certain dissemination of his works by the force of their
own great merits.”</p>

<p>A word as to my mode of rendering Bastiat. I have not
aimed at giving a literal translation. Indeed, the language
often employed by Bastiat hardly admits of literal translation.
But the more important object, I trust, has been
attained of conveying fully, plainly, and intelligibly the
author’s precise meaning.</p>

<p>The materials of the following notice of the life and writings
of
Bastiat have been borrowed partly from a short account of him in the
<em class="e000I2">Dictionnaire de l’Économie Politique</em>, partly
from the Memoir and Correspondence prefixed to the author’s <em
class="e000I2">Œuvres Complètes</em>, and partly from an able article
in the <em class="e000I2">Revue des Deux Mondes</em> from the pen of
M. Louis Reybaud.</p>

LIFE AND WRITINGS OF FRÉDÉRIC BASTIAT.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">
<em class="e00S02">Frédéric Bastiat</em>, whose last and greatest,
though, alas! unfinished
work—the <em class="e000I2">Harmonies Économiques</em>—I now venture to
introduce to the English public, was born at Bayonne, on the
19th of June 1801. His father, an eminent merchant of Bayonne,
died young, and his wife having died before him, Frédéric, their
only child, was left an orphan at the early age of nine years.</p>

<p>The care of his education devolved on his paternal grandfather,
who was proprietor of a land estate near Mugron, in the arrondissement
of Saint-Sever. His aunt, Mademoiselle Justine Bastiat,
acted towards him the part of a mother, and her affection was
warmly reciprocated by Bastiat, who, to the day of his death,
never ceased to regard her with filial love and reverence.</p>

<p>Bastiat’s education was begun at Bayonne, continued at Saint-Sever,
and finished at the College of Sorèze. Here his course of
study was occasionally interrupted by indisposition; but, on his
recovery, his quick parts and steady application soon enabled him
to overtake and keep pace with his fellow-students. At Sorèze.
Bastiat formed a boyish friendship with M. Calmètes, to whom his
earliest letters are addressed. The attachment of the youths was
so remarkable, that the masters permitted them to prepare their
exercises together, and sign them with their joint names. In this
way they gained a prize for poetry. The prize was a gold medal,
which, of course, could not be divided. “Keep it,” said Bastiat
to his friend: “I am an orphan; you have both father and mother,
and the medal of right falls to them.”</p>

<p>In 1818, Bastiat left College, and, in compliance with the wishes
of his family, entered his uncle’s counting-house at Bayonne. His
<a id="p010" class="xxpn">[p010]</a> tastes, however, were for study
rather than for business, and while
at Bayonne he devoted his leisure hours by turns to French,
English, and Italian literature. “I aim at nothing less,” he said,
“than to become acquainted with politics, history, geography,
mathematics, mechanics, natural history, botany, and four or five
languages.” He was fond of music, sang agreeably, and played
well on the violoncello.</p>

<p>In 1824, he began to study the works of the leading Economists
of France and England—Adam Smith, Jean Baptiste Say, and
Destutt de Tracy; and even at this early period he took an
interest in the English free-trade measures of Mr Huskisson.
From this time he may be said to have devoted his life to his
favourite science.</p>

<p>On the death of his grandfather, in 1825, he gave up commerce
as a profession, and took up his residence on his paternal estate
at Mugron, in the cultivation of which he was at first induced
to engage, but without much success, and he soon relinquished
agriculture, as he had before abandoned trade. Business, in truth,
was not his vocation; he had no turn for details; he cared
little for money; his wants were few and simple; and he had no
intention, as he says in one of his letters, to undergo irksome
labour for three-fourths of his life to ensure for the remainder a
useless superfluity.</p>

<p>It was at this period, and at Mugron, that he formed his lifelong
friendship with M. Felix Coudroy, to whom so much of his
correspondence is addressed, and to whom, a short time before
his death, he had thought of committing the task of finishing
the second volume of the <em class="e000I2">Harmonies</em>. The two friends, whose
tastes and pursuits were the same, were constantly together,—reading,
walking, or conversing. If Bastiat, whose ardent nature
was impatient of plodding and systematic application, received a
new book from Paris, he immediately carried it to Coudroy, who
examined it, and noted the remarkable passages, which he read
afterwards to his friend. Bastiat would often content himself
with such fragments; and it was only when the book interested
him deeply, that he would carry it off to read it carefully by
himself. On these days, says his biographer, music was laid
aside, and the violoncello was mute. It was thus, he continues,
that the two friends passed their lives together, lodging a few
paces from each other, seeing one another three times a-day,
sometimes in their chambers, sometimes in long walks, sauntering
together, book in hand. Works of philosophy, history, politics,
religion, poetry, travels, biography, political economy, socialist
<a id="p011" class="xxpn">[p011]</a> works of the day,—all passed under
the ordeal of this double
intelligence. It was in these conversations that the ideas of
Bastiat were developed, and his thoughts matured. When anything
struck him particularly, he would set to work of a morning
and put it into shape without effort. In this way he wrote his
<em class="e000I2">Sophismes</em>, his article on the French and English
tariffs, etc. It
was this literary friendship, which lasted for more than twenty
years, without being once clouded by the slightest disagreement,
which prepared the mind of Bastiat for the gigantic efforts he was
destined afterwards to make, and enabled him, during the last
five years of his life, amid disease and distraction, to give to the
world that mass of original and varied ideas which compose the
six volumes of his collected works.<a
href="#FN_2" id="FNa_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>In the events to which the expulsion of the elder branch of
the Bourbons gave rise in 1830, Bastiat took an active interest.
Bayonne had pronounced in favour of the new order of things.
The citadel alone held out, and continued to display the white
flag; and a concentration of Spanish troops on the frontier was
spoken of. Bastiat did not hesitate. Quitting Mugron, he hurried
to Bayonne to take part in the movement. In conjunction with
some of his friends, he prepared a proclamation, formed an association
of six hundred determined young men, and did not despair
of reducing the citadel by a <em class="e000I2">coup de main</em>. Happily their martial
ardour was not put to the proof. Before the march of events all
resistance gave way, and that same day the citadel opened its
gates. In place of a battle, there was a feast;—punch, wine, and
Béranger enlivened the evening;—and the officers, like horses just
let loose from the stable, were the merriest of the party.<a
href="#FN_3" id="FNa_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Such
was the beginning and the end of Bastiat’s military career.</p>

<p>In 1831, he became <em class="e000I2">Juge de Paix</em> of the Canton
of Mugron, and,
in 1832, a Member of the Council-General of the Landes. The confidence
and esteem of his neighbourhood would have invested him
with a trust still more important, by sending him as a representative
to the Chamber of Deputies; but in this, after three fruitless
attempts, his friends were defeated, and Bastiat did not succeed in
becoming a legislator until after the Revolution of February 1848.</p>

<p>He published, in 1834, <em class="e000I2">Réflexions sur les Pétitions de Bordeaux,
le Havre et Lyon, concernant les douanes</em>,—a brochure of great
vigour, and which contains the germ of the theory of Value
developed fifteen years afterwards in the <em class="e000I2">Harmonies</em>. <a id="p012" class="xxpn">[p012]</a></p>

<p>In 1840, Bastiat visited Spain and Portugal; and after a sojourn
of some months at Madrid, and afterwards at Lisbon, with great
benefit to his health, he sailed thence for England, and spent a
few weeks in London. On his return to Mugron, he wrote his
pamphlet, <em class="e000I2">Le Fisc et la Vigne</em>, in which he protests against certain
new duties with which the wine-trade of his native province was
threatened. In this brochure<a
href="#FN_4" id="FNa_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> he gives a characteristic anecdote
of Napoleon. At the outset, the duties imposed were so moderate
that the receipts would scarcely defray the cost of collection. The
Minister of Finance remonstrated, and represented that these imposts
were making the Government unpopular, without any benefit
to the revenue. “You are a noodle, Monsieur Maret,” said the
Emperor; “since the nation grumbles at some light burdens, what
would have been the consequence had I added heavy taxes?
Accustom them, first of all, to the exercise; and then we can reform
the tariff.” The great captain, adds Bastiat, was also a
skilful financier. Begin by inserting the thin end of the wedge—accustom
them to the exercise—such is the history of all taxes.</p>

<p>In 1843, appeared another pamphlet, entitled <em class="e000I2">Mémoire sur la
question vinicole</em>; and in 1844, <em class="e000I2">Mémoire sur la
répartition de l’impôt
foncier dans le Département des Landes</em>,—both productions of extraordinary
ability, but having reference principally to questions
of local interest and importance. The great subject of Free
Trade, to which he was afterwards to devote his vast powers,
had then assumed in his mind rather the form of a vague dream of
what might perchance be realized under favourable circumstances
at some far distant day, than of a thing in sober reality to be
expected or hoped for. It was an accidental circumstance which
first directed his attention to what was then passing in England
under the auspices of the Anti-corn-law League.</p>

<p>Among the circle which Bastiat frequented at Mugron there
prevailed a strong prejudice, or rather an inveterate hatred,
against England; and Bastiat, who had cultivated English literature,
and imbibed English ideas, had often to break a lance with his
acquaintances on the subject of this unfounded dislike. One of
these <em class="e000I2">Anglophobes</em>, accosting him one day,
handed him a newspaper. “Read that,” said he with bitterness, “and
see how your friends are treating us!” It was a translation of a
speech of Sir Robert Peel in the House of Commons, which concluded
with the words—“If we adopt this course, we shall fall, <em
class="e000I2">like France</em>, to the lowest rank among nations.”
His country was insulted, and Bastiat had not a word to say. On
reflection, however, it did <a id="p013" class="xxpn">[p013]</a>
appear strange to him that the Prime Minister of England should
entertain such an opinion of France, and still more so, that,
entertaining it, he should express it openly and offensively in his
place in Parliament. To clear up the matter, Bastiat wrote instantly
to Paris, and became a subscriber to an English newspaper, requesting
that all the numbers for the preceding month might be sent to him. In
a few days the <em class="e000I2">Globe and Traveller</em> made its
appearance at Mugron, containing Sir Robert Peel’s speech, when it
was discovered that the words “like France,” maliciously introduced
into the French version of it, were <em class="e000I2">not</em>
there, and, in fact, had never been uttered.</p>

<p>Bastiat continued to read the <em class="e000I2">Globe</em>, and
soon made the more important discovery that a formidable agitation
was at that time going on in England to which the French newspapers
never once alluded. The Anti-corn-law League was shaking the basis
of the old commercial legislation of England. For two years Bastiat
was thus enabled to watch the progress of the movement, and at length
began to entertain the idea of making known to his countrymen—and,
perhaps, of inducing them to imitate—the important reform about to be
accomplished on the other side of the channel.</p>

<p>It was this feeling which prompted him to send to the <em
class="e000I2">Journal des Économistes</em> his first contribution,
<em class="e000I2">Sur l’influence des tarifs Anglais et
Français</em>. This article, bearing a signature till then unknown,
and coming from the remote Department of the Landes, was at once
accepted, and created a profound impression. Like Lord Byron,
after the publication of <em class="e000I2">Childe Harold</em>,
Bastiat “awoke one morning and found himself famous.” Compliments
and encouragements showered in upon him from every side. Further
contributions were solicited, and were sent. The ice was broken,
and he was fairly afloat as an author. Whilst contributing
various articles to the <em class="e000I2">Journal</em>—among
others, the first series of the <em class="e000I2">Sophismes
Économiques</em>—Bastiat began to write the history of the English
Anti-corn-law League; and, in order to obtain fuller information and
more copious materials, he opened a correspondence with Mr Cobden,
with whom he continued to exchange letters at frequent intervals
during the remainder of his life.</p>

<p>It was in 1845 that Bastiat went to Paris to superintend the
printing of this work, which he entitled <em class="e000I2">Cobden et
la Ligue, où l’agitation Anglaise pour la liberté des Échanges</em>.
A luminous and spirited introduction, giving an account of the
economical and political state of England prior to the Anti-corn-law
agitation, and describing the origin, objects, and progress of the
league, is <a id="p014" class="xxpn">[p014]</a> followed by extracts
from the more prominent speeches of Cobden, Bright, Fox, Thompson,
and the other leaders. All this was new in France,—to the popular
mind of that country it might almost be called a revelation. “I have
distributed a hundred copies in Paris,” writes Bastiat to Cobden,
“and they have produced the best impression. Men who, by their
position and pursuits, ought to know what is going on in England
have been surprised on reading it. They could not believe their
eyes.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. If I had combated directly
their prejudices, I should not have succeeded; but, by allowing the
free-traders to speak and act for themselves—in a word, by simply
<em class="e000I2">translating</em> you—I hope to have given these
prejudices a blow which they cannot recover—if the book be read.” In
a subsequent letter, he says,—“Since my last letter an unexpected
movement has manifested itself in the French press. All the Parisian,
and many of the provincial journals, in reviewing my book, have given
an account of the Anti-corn-law agitation. They do not, it is true,
perceive all its bearings, but public opinion is awakened, which is
the essential point.”</p>

<p>To this work, and the service which it rendered to the cause of
Free Trade, and of sound economic ideas, Bastiat some months
afterwards owed his nomination as a Corresponding Member of
the Institute. “I believe this nomination to be in itself of little
importance,” he writes to M. Calmètes, “and I fear many mediocrities
have boasted of the title; but the peculiar circumstances
which preceded my nomination do not permit me to reject your
friendly felicitations. I have published only one book, and of that
book the preface alone is my work. Having returned to seclusion,
that preface has worked for me, and unknown to me; for the
same letter which apprized me of my candidature announced my
election. I had never in my life dreamt of this honour. The book
is entitled <em class="e000I2">Cobden et la Ligue</em>. I now send it to you, which will
save my saying more about it. In 1842 and 1843 I endeavoured
to attract attention to the subject of which it treats. I addressed
articles to the <em class="e000I2">Presse</em>, to the <em class="e000I2">Mémorial Bordelais</em>, and other journals.
They were rejected. I saw that my cause was about to break
down under this <em class="e000I2">conspiracy of silence</em>, and I had no resource but to
write a book. You see, then, why I have become an author.
And now, engaged in that career, I regret it extremely; for
although always fond of Political Economy, I am reluctant to
devote my attention exclusively to that science, and would rather
wander freely over the whole field of human knowledge. Yet in
this science a single question—freedom of international relations—fascinates
and is about to absorb me,—for, perhaps, you may <a id="p015" class="xxpn">[p015]</a>
have seen that I have been assigned a place in the association
which has just been formed at Bordeaux. Such is the age;
you can take no part in public life without being garrotted in
a speciality.”</p>

<p>At Paris, Bastiat had been introduced to all the leading Economists,
and he was delighted with his reception. “Not one of
these gentlemen,” he says to M. Coudroy, “but had read, re-read,
and perfectly understood my three articles. I might have written
a thousand years in the <em class="e000I2">Chalosse</em>, the <em class="e000I2">Sentinelle</em>, and the <em class="e000I2">Mémorial</em>,
without finding a single true reader but yourself. Here one is
read, studied, and understood.” By the whole circle Bastiat was
welcomed and feasted. A desire was expressed that he should
become conductor of the <em class="e000I2">Journal des Économistes</em>, and there was a
proposal to find him a chair of Political Economy.</p>

<p>From Paris he passed over to England, where, in July 1845, he
met with Mr Cobden, Mr Bright, and the other chiefs of the
Anti-corn-law League. In a letter to his friend Coudroy, he
thus describes his reception in London:—“Having installed
myself at the hotel (at 10s. a-day), I sat down to write six letters,
to Cobden, Bright, Fox, Thompson, Wilson, and the Secretary of
the League. Then I wrote six inscriptions on as many copies
of my book, and went to bed. This morning I carried my six
volumes to the apartments of the League, desiring that they might
be sent to the parties for whom they were intended. I was told
that Mr Cobden was in town, and was to leave London to-day for
Manchester, and that I should find him in the midst of preparations
for his journey. (An Englishman’s preparations consist in
swallowing a beef-steak, and stuffing a couple of shirts into a
carpet-bag.) I hastened to Cobden’s residence, where I met him,
and had two hours’ talk. He knows French very well, speaks it
a little, and, moreover, I understood his English. I explained to
him the state of opinion in France, the effects I expected from my
work, etc. He was sorry to leave London, and was on the point
of giving up his intended journey. Then he remarked, ‘The
League is free-masonry, except that everything is public. We
have a house here, which we have hired to accommodate our
friends during the bazaar; it is empty at present, and we must
instal you there.’ I made some difficulty about this; and he
rejoined, ‘This arrangement may not be agreeable to you, but it
will be of use to the cause, for Messrs Bright, Moore, and other
members of the League pass their evenings there, and we must
have you always in the midst of them.’ However, as I am to
join him at Manchester the day after to-morrow, I thought it
<a id="p016" class="xxpn">[p016]</a> hardly worth while to shift my quarters for a couple of days. He
took me afterwards to the Reform Club, a magnificent establishment,
and left me in the library while he took a bath. He afterwards
wrote letters to Bright and Moore, and I accompanied him
to the railway. In the evening I called on Mr Bright.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.
Obliged to speak slowly, in order to make myself understood,
and upon subjects which were familiar to me, and with men who
had all our ideas, I found myself placed in the most favourable
circumstances. He took me afterwards to the Parliament,” etc.</p>

<p>On his return from England, Bastiat again took refuge in his
retreat at Mugron, where he had his time entirely at his own
disposal; but he was not long suffered to enjoy his literary leisure.
In February 1846, he assisted in organizing a Free-Trade Association
at Bordeaux, and afterwards went to Paris with a similar
object. In this he was destined to experience innumerable difficulties,
not the least of which arose from his supposed attachment
to English opinions. He imagined the reform of the English
tariff might be the means of furthering a similar reform in France,
but in this he soon found that he was greatly mistaken.</p>

<p>“Of all the prejudices which reign among us,” says M. Louis
Reybaud, in his admirable notice of Bastiat in the <em class="e000I2">Revue des Deux
Mondes</em>,<a
href="#FN_5" id="FNa_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> “there is none more deeply rooted than distrust of
England. It is enough that England leans to one side to induce
us to incline to the other. Everything which England proposes
is suspected by us, and we not unwillingly detect an ambush in
all her measures. In matters of trade this disposition is especially
manifested. In vain we imagine that England in her reforms has
only her own interest in view,—her true object is only to mislead
and ruin us by her seductions! If we give way we shall be fools
or dupes. Such is the language of national opinion; and although
enlightened men resist it, that opinion does not the less prevail
and exhibit itself on all occasions. Better informed in regard to
this bias of public opinion, Bastiat would have seen that the
moment was not opportune, and that in the face of the English
agitation he would have done better to delay, than to hasten, any
agitation in France which might seem to be inspired by the spirit
or example of England.”</p>

<p>In fact, it was upon this rock mainly that Bastiat’s Free-trade
enterprise ultimately foundered, and he soon became convinced of
the intensity of the prejudice against which he had to struggle.
In a letter to Mr Cobden, written in December 1846, he says,—“This
cry against England stifles us, and gives rise to formidable
<a id="p017" class="xxpn">[p017]</a> obstacles. If this hatred to <em class="e000I2">perfidious Albion</em> were only the fashion
of the day, I should wait patiently until it passed away. But it
has deep root in men’s hearts. It is universal, and I believe I
told you that my friends dare no longer talk of me in my own
village, but <em class="e000I2">en famille</em>. This blind passion, moreover, is found so
convenient by protected interests and political parties, that they
avail themselves of it in the most shameless manner.”</p>

<p>Other circumstances contributed to discourage Bastiat: “I
suffer from my poverty,” he tells Mr Cobden. “If, instead of
running from one to another on foot, splashed and bespattered to
the back, in order to meet only one or two people a-day, and
obtain evasive and dilatory answers, I could assemble them at my
table in a rich <em class="e000I2">salon</em>, how many difficulties would be removed! I
want neither head nor heart, but I feel that this superb Babylon
is not the place for me, and I must hasten back to my solitude.”
His heart was constantly reverting to the happy and peaceful days
he had passed at Mugron. “I suffer,” he says in a letter to
Coudroy, “from leaving Mugron, and my old habits, my desultory
labours, and our nice little chats. It is a frightful <em class="e000I2">déchirement</em>;
but can I recede?” “Paris and I are not made for each other.”
“Often I think of Mugron, its philosophic calm, and its fruitful
leisure. Here life is wasted in doing nothing, or at least in
producing nothing.”</p>

<p>Bastiat’s appearance in Paris at this epoch is thus described by
one of his friends. “He had not had time to call in the assistance
of a Parisian hatter and tailor,” says M. de Molinari; “and with
his long hair, his tiny hat, his ample frock-coat, and his family
umbrella, you would have been apt to mistake him for an honest
peasant, who had come to town for the first time to see the
wonders of the metropolis. But the physiognomy of this apparent
clown was arch and spiritual; his large black eye was
luminous, and his square well-proportioned forehead bore the
impress of thought.”</p>

<p>“I remember, as if it were yesterday,” says M. Louis Reybaud,
“the impression which he produced. It was impossible to see a
more characteristic specimen of a provincial scholar, simple in his
manner, and plain in his attire. But, under that homely garb,
and that air of <em class="e000I2">bonhomie</em>, there were flashes of intelligence, and a
native dignity of deportment; and you were not long in discovering
an honest heart and a generous soul. The eye, above all,
was lighted up with singular brightness and fire. His emaciated
features and livid complexion betrayed already the ravages of that
disease which, in a few years, was destined to carry him off. His
<a id="p018" class="xxpn">[p018]</a> voice was hollow, and formed a contrast with the vivacity of his
ideas and the briskness of his gestures. When the conversation
was animated, his voice became feebler, and his lungs performed
their office with difficulty. Better taken care of, his constitution,
feeble as it was, might have lasted a long time. But Bastiat took
counsel only of his energy. He never thought of how many days
he had to live, but how he might employ them well.”<a
href="#FN_6" id="FNa_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>“I accept resolutely the hard life on which I am about to
enter,” he says in one of his letters. “What gives me courage
is not the <em class="e000I2">non omnis moriar</em> of Horace, but the thought that, perhaps,
my life may not have been useless to mankind.”<a
href="#FN_7" id="FNa_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>During the eighteen months that the Free-trade Association
lasted, Bastiat’s life was one of feverish activity and incessant
unremitting toil. Before the doors of the Association could be
opened to the public, a Government <em class="e000I2">autorisation</em> had to be
obtained; and it was obtained at length with much difficulty and
after long delay. On Bastiat, as secretary, the care of all the
arrangements devolved. He had to communicate with journalists,
wait upon ministers, issue manifestoes, organize committees,
obtain subscriptions, correspond with branch associations, undertake
journeys to Lyons, to Marseilles, to Havre, attend meetings,
make speeches, besides conducting a weekly newspaper, called
the <em class="e000I2">Libre-Échange</em>—the organ of the Association—and contributing
numerous articles to other newspapers, and to the <em class="e000I2">Journal
des Économistes</em>. “If at daybreak he observed a Protectionist
sophism appear in a newspaper of any reputation,” says M. de
Molinari, “he would immediately seize his pen, demolish the
sophism before breakfast, and our language counted one <em class="e000I2">chef-d’œuvre</em>
the more.”</p>

<p>It is to the marvellous exertions of this period that we owe the
<em class="e000I2">Sophismes Économiques</em>,—a work which arose out of the circumstances
in which Bastiat found himself placed; and which,
although written from day to day, amid the distractions we have
described, exhibits his genius in its most brilliant light. “As
examples of dialectical skill in reducing an opponent to absurdity,”
says Professor Cairnes, “of simple and felicitous illustration, of
delicate and polished raillery, attaining occasionally the pitch
of a refined irony, the <em class="e000I2">Sophismes Économiques</em> may almost claim a
place beside the <em class="e000I2">Provincial Letters</em>.” Sprightly, lucid, and conclusive,
full of fire and irony, playfulness and wit, these two
little volumes afford the most unanswerable reply ever given to the
<a id="p019" class="xxpn">[p019]</a> fallacies of the Protectionist school; and, had Bastiat written
nothing else, they would have conferred on him a just title to
be regarded as the most distinguished economist of his day. The
<em class="e000I2">Sophismes</em> have been translated into four languages, and are the
best known, if not the most original, of all the works of their
lamented author.</p>

<p>The success of the work was instant and complete. Bastiat at
first complained that “three or four pleasantries had made the
fortune of the book, while the serious parts were neglected;” but
he afterwards confessed that “parables and pleasantries had more
success, and effected more good, than the best treatises.” Of these
pleasantries, <em class="e000I2">The Candlemakers’ Petition</em>, in the first series of the
<em class="e000I2">Sophismes</em>, is perhaps the happiest, and I cannot forbear presenting
the reader with a translation of this choice morsel:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div id="petition-19">

<p><em class="e00S02">Petition</em> of the Manufacturers of
Candles, Wax-Lights, Lamps, Candlesticks, Street Lamps, Snuffers,
Extinguishers, and of the Producers of Oil, Tallow, Rosin, Alcohol,
and, generally, of everything connected with Lighting,</p>

<p><em class="e00S02">To Messieurs the Members of the Chamber of
Deputies.</em></p>
</div>

<p><em class="e00S02">Gentlemen</em>,—You are on the right road.
You reject abstract theories, and have little consideration for
cheapness and plenty. Your chief care is the interest of the
producer. You desire to emancipate him from external competition,
and reserve the <em class="e000I2">national market</em> for <em
class="e000I2">national industry</em>.</p>

<p>We are about to offer you an admirable opportunity of
applying your—what shall we call it? your theory? No; nothing
is more deceptive than theory; your doctrine? your system? your
principle?—but you dislike doctrines, you abhor systems, and as for
principles, you deny that there are any in Social Economy: we shall
say, then, your practice, your practice without theory and without
principle.</p>

<p>We are suffering from the intolerable competition of a foreign
rival, placed, it would seem, in a condition so far superior
to ours for the production of light, that he absolutely <em
class="e000I2">inundates</em> our <em class="e000I2">national
market</em> with it at a price fabulously reduced. The moment he
shows himself, our trade leaves us—all consumers apply to him; and a
branch of native industry, having countless ramifications, is all at
once rendered completely stagnant. This rival, who is no other than
the Sun, wages war to the knife against us, and we suspect he has
been raised up by <em class="e000I2">perfidious Albion</em> (good
policy as times go); inasmuch as he displays towards that haughty
island a circumspection with which he dispenses in our case.</p>

<p>What we pray for is, that it may please you to pass a law ordering
the shutting up of all Windows, Sky-lights, Dormer-windows, Outside
and Inside Shutters, Curtains, Blinds, Bull’s-eyes; in a word, of
all Openings, Holes, Chinks, Clefts, and Fissures, by or through
which the light of the Sun has been allowed to enter houses, to the
prejudice of the meritorious manufactures with which we flatter
ourselves we have accommodated our country,—a country which, in
gratitude, ought not to abandon us now to a strife so unequal.</p>

<p>We trust, Gentlemen, that you will not regard this our request
as a satire, or refuse it without at least previously hearing the
reasons which we have to urge in its support.</p>

<p>And, first, if you shut up as much as possible all access to
natural light, and create a demand for artificial light, which of our
French manufactures will not be encouraged by it?</p>

<p>If more tallow is consumed, then there must be more oxen and
sheep; and, consequently, we shall behold the increase of artificial
meadows, meat, wool, hides, and, above all, manure, which is the
basis and foundation of all agricultural wealth.</p>

<p>If more oil is consumed, then we shall have an extended cultivation of the poppy,
of the olive, and of rape. These rich and exhausting plants will come at the right
<a id="p020" class="xxpn">[p020]</a> time to enable us to avail ourselves of the increased fertility which the rearing of
additional cattle will impart to our lands.</p>

<p>Our heaths will be covered with resinous trees. Numerous swarms of bees will,
on the mountains, gather perfumed treasures, now wasting their fragrance on the
desert air, like the flowers from which they are derived. No branch of agriculture
but will then exhibit a cheering development.</p>

<p>The same remark applies to navigation. Thousands of vessels will proceed to the
whale fishery; and, in a short time, we shall possess a navy capable of maintaining
the honour of France, and gratifying the patriotic aspirations of your petitioners,
the undersigned Candlemakers and others.</p>

<p>But what shall we say of the manufacture of <em class="e000I2">articles de Paris</em>? Henceforth you
will behold gildings, bronzes, crystals, in candlesticks, in lamps, in lustres, in
candelabra, shining forth, in spacious warerooms, compared with which those of the
present day can be regarded but as mere shops.</p>

<p>No poor <em class="e000I2">Resinier</em> from his heights on the sea-coast, no Coal-miner from the
depth of his sable gallery, but will rejoice in higher wages and increased prosperity.</p>

<p>Only have the goodness to reflect, Gentlemen, and you will be convinced that
there is, perhaps, no Frenchman, from the wealthy coal-master to the humblest
vender of lucifer matches, whose lot will not be ameliorated by the success of this
our Petition.</p>

<p>We foresee your objections, Gentlemen, but we know that you can oppose to us
none but such as you have picked up from the effete works of the partisans of Free
Trade. We defy you to utter a single word against us which will not instantly
rebound against yourselves and your entire policy.</p>

<p>You will tell us that, if we gain by the protection which we seek,
the country will lose by it, because the consumer must bear the
loss.</p>

<p>We answer:</p>

<p>You have ceased to have any right to invoke the interest of
the consumer; for, whenever his interest is found opposed to that
of the producer, you sacrifice the former. You have done so for
the purpose of <em class="e000I2">encouraging labour</em> and <em
class="e000I2">increasing employment</em>. For the same reason, you
should do so again.</p>

<p>You have yourselves obviated this objection. When you are told
that the consumer is interested in the free importation of iron,
coal, corn, textile fabrics,—yes, you reply, but the producer is
interested in their exclusion. Well, be it so;—if consumers are
interested in the free admission of natural light, the producers of
artificial light are equally interested in its prohibition.</p>

<p>But, again, you may say that the producer and consumer are
identical. If the manufacturer gain by protection, he will make
the agriculturist also a gainer; and, if agriculture prospers, it
will open a vent to manufactures. Very well; if you confer upon
us the monopoly of furnishing light during the day,—first of all,
we shall purchase quantities of tallow, coals, oils, resinous
substances, wax, alcohol,—besides silver, iron, bronze, crystal—to
carry on our manufactures; and then we and those who furnish us with
such commodities, having become rich, will consume a great deal,
and impart prosperity to all the other branches of our national
industry.</p>

<p>If you urge that the light of the Sun is a gratuitous gift
of nature, and that to reject such gifts is to reject wealth
itself under pretence of encouraging the means of acquiring it,
we would caution you against giving a death-blow to your own
policy. Remember that hitherto you have always repelled foreign
products, <em class="e000I2">because</em> they approximate more
nearly than home products to the character of gratuitous gifts. To
comply with the exactions of other monopolists, you have only <em
class="e000I2">half a motive</em>; and to repulse us simply because
we stand on a stronger vantage ground than others, would be to
adopt the equation, +&#160;×&#160;+&#160;=&#160;-; in other words,
it would be to heap <em class="e000I2">absurdity</em> upon <em
class="e000I2">absurdity</em>.</p>

<p>Nature and human labour co-operate in various proportions
(depending on countries and climates) in the production of
commodities. The part which nature executes is always gratuitous; it
is the part executed by human labour which constitutes value, and is
paid for.</p>

<p>If a Lisbon orange sells for half the price of a Paris orange, it
is because natural, and consequently gratuitous heat, does for the
one, what artificial, and therefore expensive heat, must do for the
other.</p>

<p>When an orange comes to us from Portugal, we may conclude
that it is furnished in part gratuitously, in part for an
onerous consideration; in other words, it comes to us at <em
class="e000I2">half-price</em> as compared with those of Paris.</p>

<p>Now, it is precisely the <em class="e000I2">gratuitous half</em>
(pardon the word) which we contend should be excluded. You say,
how can national labour sustain competition with foreign labour,
when the former has all the work to do, and the latter only
does one-half,—the Sun supplying the remainder? But if this <em
class="e000I2">half</em>, being <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>,
determines <a id="p021" class="xxpn">[p021]</a> you to exclude competition, how should the <em
class="e000I2">whole</em>, being <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>,
induce you to admit competition? If you were consistent, you
would, while excluding as hurtful to native industry what is half
gratuitous, exclude, <em class="e000I2">a fortiori</em> and with
double zeal, that which is altogether gratuitous.</p>

<p>Once more, when products, such as coal, iron, corn, or textile
fabrics, are sent us from abroad, and we can acquire them with less
labour than if we made them ourselves, the difference is a free
gift conferred upon us. The gift is more or less considerable in
proportion as the difference is more or less great. It amounts to a
quarter, a half, or three-quarters of the value of the product, when
the foreigner only asks us for three-fourths, a half, or a quarter of
the price we should otherwise pay. It is as perfect and complete as
it can be, when the donor (like the Sun in furnishing us with light)
asks us for nothing. The question, and we ask it formally, is this,
Do you desire for our country the benefit of gratuitous consumption,
or the pretended advantages of onerous production? Make your choice,
but be logical; for as long as you exclude as you do, coal, iron,
corn, foreign fabrics, <em class="e000I2">in proportion</em> as
their price approximates to <em class="e000I2">zero</em>, what
inconsistency would it be to admit the light of the Sun, the price of
which is already at <em class="e000I2">zero</em> during the entire
day!</p></div>

<p>In addition to his other engrossing avocations in Paris, Bastiat,
in the end of 1847 and beginning of 1848, delivered a course of
lectures to young men on the principles of Political Economy and
the Harmony of the Social Laws. He had no opportunity of
committing these lectures to writing, as he wished, but we have
doubtless the substance of them in his published works, especially
in the <em class="e000I2">Harmonies Économiques</em>. “Something tells me,” he says
in one of his letters to M. Coudroy, “that this course addressed
to the young, who have logic in their heads, and warmth and
fervour in their hearts, will not be useless.” “My auditors,” he
says elsewhere, “are not very numerous; but they attend
assiduously, and take notes. The seed falls into good ground.”</p>

<p>It was in the midst of these harassing occupations and herculean
exertions that the Revolution of February came to surprise
Bastiat,—to put an end to the Free-trade Association,—and to
bring a far more formidable set of agitators—namely, the Socialists
and Communists—to the surface of society. Bastiat doubted
if his country was ripe for a Republic; but when it came,
he gave in his adhesion to it, and was returned by his native
Department of the Landes as a Deputy to the Constituent, and
afterwards to the Legislative Assembly. He took his seat on the
left, says his accomplished friend and biographer M. de Fontenay,
in an attitude of moderation and firmness; and, whilst remaining
somewhat isolated, he was surrounded with the respect of all
parties. A Member of the Committee of Finance, of which he
was named Vice-President eight times in succession, he exercised
a very marked influence on that department, although quietly and
within doors. The increasing feebleness of his lungs prevented
his often ascending the tribune or addressing the Assembly,
although it was often a hard trial for him to be thus, as it were,
nailed to his seat.<a
href="#FN_8" id="FNa_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> It is to this he alludes in the second chapter
<a id="p022" class="xxpn">[p022]</a> of the <em class="e000I2">Harmonies</em>:—“If, when the much-loved vessel of the State
is beaten by the tempest, I sometimes appear to absent myself
from my post in order to collect my scattered thoughts, it is because
I feel my feeble hands unfitted for the work. Is it, besides,
to betray my mission to reflect upon the causes of the tempest
itself, and endeavour to act upon these causes? And then, what
I find I cannot do to-day, who knows but it may be given me to
accomplish to-morrow?”</p>

<p>In a letter to M. Coudroy, in June 1848, Bastiat thus describes
his daily occupations:—“I rise at six o’clock, dress, shave, breakfast,
and read the newspapers; this occupies me till seven, or
half-past seven. About nine, I am obliged to go out, for at ten
commences the sitting of the Committee of Finance, of which I
am a member. It continues till one, and then the public sitting
begins, and continues till seven. I return to dinner, and it very
rarely happens that there are not after-dinner meetings of Sub-Committees
charged with special questions. The only hour at
my disposal is from eight to nine in the morning, and it is at that
hour that I receive visitors.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. I am profoundly disgusted with
this kind of life.”</p>

<p>But the grand work of Bastiat in 1848 and 1849—a work to
which he devoted the best energies of his mind and genius—was
the open and incessant war which he waged with the Socialist and
Communist writers and agitators whom the Revolution had let
loose on French society, and who were then shaking the social
and political fabric to its centre. Bastiat, like the porcupine, had
a quill pointed against every assailant. To each error he opposed
a pamphlet. With Louis Blanc and the national workshops, he
did battle in the brochure entitled <em class="e000I2">Propriété et Loi</em>, in which he
exposes the illusions with which the public mind had been stuffed
by the Socialists. The doctrine of Concidérant he attacked in
another little volume, bearing the title, <em class="e000I2">Propriété et Spoliation</em>. In
another, <em class="e000I2">Justice et Fraternité</em>, he demolished the absurdities of
Pierre Leroux’s democratic and social constitution. Proudhon’s
doctrine he disposed of in <em class="e000I2">Capital et Rente</em>, where he refutes the
foolish notions in vogue in 1848 on the subject of gratuitous loans—a
subject which he again discussed in 1850, in the larger volume
entitled <em class="e000I2">Gratuité du Credit</em>. In <em class="e000I2">Protectionisme et Communisme</em>,
Bastiat demonstrated that what is called <em class="e000I2">protection</em> is nothing else
than practical communism or spoliation. <em class="e000I2">Paix et Liberté, ou le
Budget Républicain</em>, another brochure from his prolific pen, is a
brilliant and vigorous onslaught on the excessive taxation of that
day, and the overgrown military and naval armaments which gave
<a id="p023" class="xxpn">[p023]</a> rise to it. Many passages of this admirable production, full of force
and practical good sense, might be read with benefit at the present
day, as applicable not only to France as it was, but to France as
it is, and not to France alone, but to the other nations of Europe.</p>

<p>In the tract entitled <em class="e000I2">L’État</em>, Bastiat maintains his favourite
doctrine that all which a Government owes to its subjects is security;
that, as it acts necessarily through the intervention of force,
it can equitably enforce nothing save Justice; and that its duty
consists in holding the balance equal among various interests, by
guarding the liberty of all, by protecting person and property, by
enforcing covenants, and thereby upholding credit, but leaving
Demand and Supply in all cases to perform their appropriate
functions without restraint and without encouragement. He exposes
the absurdity of men expecting everything from Government,
and trusting to public employments rather than to individual
exertion. He shows that, since the State is only an aggregate of
individuals, it can give nothing to the people but what it has
previously taken from them. <em class="e000I2">Tout le monde</em>, as he says elsewhere,
<em class="e000I2">veut vivre aux dépens de l’état, et on oublie que l’état vit aux dépens
de tout le monde</em>.</p>

<p>To this tract another is appended, to which he gives the quaint
title of <em class="e000I2">Maudit Argent!</em> in which he exposes the popular errors
which arise from confounding capital with money, and money
with inconvertible paper. In this little work, Bastiat of course
could not treat the subject systematically and in detail, as M.
Michel Chevalier has since done in his philosophical treatise <em class="e000I2">Sur
la Monnaie</em>;<a
href="#FN_9" id="FNa_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> but Bastiat’s tract contains many excellent passages.
The effect of an enlargement of the volume of currency on the
value of money, for instance, is thus happily illustrated:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ten men sat down to play a game, in which they agreed to stake 1000 francs.
Each man was provided with ten counters—each counter representing ten francs.
When the game was finished, each received as many times ten francs as he happened
to have counters. One of the party, who was more of an arithmetician than a
logician, remarked that he always found at the end of the game that he was richer
in proportion as he had a greater number of counters, and asked the others if they
had observed the same thing. What holds in my case, said he, must hold in yours,
for what is true of each must be true of all. He proposed, therefore, that each
should have double the former number of counters. No sooner said than done.
Double the number of counters were distributed; but, when the party finally rose
from play they found themselves no richer than before. The stake had not been
increased, and fell to be proportionally divided. Each man, no doubt, had double
the number of counters, but each counter, instead of being worth ten francs, was
found to be worth only five; and it was at length discovered that what is true of
each is <em class="e000I2">not</em> always true of all.</p></div>

<p>The pamphlets, <em class="e000I2">Baccalauréat et Socialisme</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Ce qu’on voit et
ce qu’on ne voit pas</em>, belong to the following year, 1850, the last
<a id="p024" class="xxpn">[p024]</a> of the author’s life. In the first of these, Bastiat complains of the
monopoly of university degrees, and the too exclusive addiction of
his countrymen to classical learning—especially Greek and Roman
history—to which he attributes much of that democratic and
revolutionary fervour which was ever and anon breaking out in
France.</p>

<p>The second, <em class="e000I2">Ce qu’on voit et ce qu’on ne voit pas</em>, is a masterpiece
worthy of the author of the <em class="e000I2">Sophismes</em>, and well deserves its
second title of “Political Economy in One Lesson.” The following
extract from the first chapter of this admirable little work will
give the reader some idea of the argument, and of Bastiat’s lively
manner of treating a subject in itself so dry and uninviting:—</p>

<div id="down1" class="center"><em class="e00S02">The Broken
Pane.</em></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Have you ever had occasion to witness the fury of the honest burgess, Jacques
Bonhomme, when his scapegrace son has broken a pane of glass? If you have, you
cannot fail to have observed that all the bystanders, were there thirty of them, lay
their heads together to offer the unfortunate proprietor this never-failing consolation,—“There
is some good in every misfortune—such accidents give a fillip to
trade. Everybody must live. If no windows were broken, what would become of
the glaziers?”</p>

<p>Now, this formula of condolence contains a theory, which it is proper to lay hold
of, <em class="e000I2">flagrante delicto</em>, in this very simple case, because it is exactly the same theory
which unfortunately governs the greater part of our economic institutions.</p>

<p>Assuming that it becomes necessary to expend six francs in repairing the damage,
if you mean to say that the accident brings in six francs to the glazier, and to that
extent encourages his trade, I grant it fairly and frankly, and allow that you reason
justly. The glazier arrives, does his work, pockets his money, rubs his hands, and
blesses the scapegrace son. This is <em class="e000I2">what we see</em>.</p>

<p>But if, by way of deduction, you come to conclude, as is too often done, that it is a
good thing to break windows, that it makes money circulate, and that encouragement
to trade in general is the result, I am obliged to cry halt! Your theory stops
at <em class="e000I2">what we see</em>, and takes no account of <em class="e000I2">what we don’t see</em>.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">We don’t see</em> that, since our burgess has been obliged to spend his six francs on
one thing, he can no longer spend them on another—<em class="e000I2">We don’t see</em> that, if he had not
had this pane to replace, he would have replaced, for example, his shoes, which are
down at the heels, or placed a new book on his shelf. In short, he would have
employed his six francs in a way in which he cannot now employ them.</p>

<p>Let us see, then, how the account stands with trade <em class="e000I2">in general</em>.</p>

<p>The pane being broken, the glazier’s trade is benefited to the extent of six francs.
This is <em class="e000I2">what we see</em>.</p>

<p>If the pane had not been broken, the shoemaker’s (or some other) trade would
have been encouraged to the extent of six francs. That is what <em class="e000I2">we don’t see</em>.</p>

<p>And if we take into account what <em class="e000I2">we don’t see</em>, which is a negative fact, as well
as what <em class="e000I2">we do see</em>, which is a positive fact, we shall discover that trade <em class="e000I2">in general</em>,
or the aggregate of <em class="e000I2">national industry</em>, has no interest, one way or other, whether
windows are broken or not.</p>

<p>Let us see, again, how the account stands with Jacques Bonhomme.</p>

<p>On the last hypothesis—that of the pane being broken—he spends six francs, and
gets neither more nor less than he had before,—namely, the use and enjoyment of a
pane of glass.</p>

<p>On the other hypothesis,—namely, that the accident had not happened, he would
have expended six francs on shoes, and would have had the use and enjoyment both
of the shoes and of the pane of glass.</p>

<p>Now, as the good burgess, Jacques Bonhomme constitutes a fraction of society at
large, we are forced to conclude that society, taken in the aggregate, and after all
accounts of labour and enjoyment have been squared, has lost the value of the pane
which has been broken.</p>

<p>Whence, on generalizing, we arrive at this unexpected conclusion, that “Society
loses the value of things uselessly destroyed;” and we arrive also at this aphorism,
which will make the hair of the prohibitionists stand on end, that “to smash, break,
<a id="p025" class="xxpn">[p025]</a> and dissipate is not to encourage national industry;” or, more briefly, that “there
is no profit in destruction.”</p>

<p>The reader will take notice that there are not two persons only, but three, in the
little drama to which we have called his attention. One of them—namely, Jacques
Bonhomme—represents the consumer, reduced by destruction to one enjoyment in
place of two. The glazier represents the producer, whose trade is encouraged by
the accident. The third is the shoemaker (or some other tradesman), whose trade
is discouraged to the same extent by the same cause. It is this third personage
who is always kept in the shade, and who, as representing <em class="e000I2">what we don’t see</em>, is a
necessary element in the problem. It is he who enables us to discover how absurd
it is to try to find profit in destruction. It is he who will soon teach us that it is not
less absurd to try to discover profit in restriction, which is, after all, only partial
destruction. Go to the bottom of all the arguments which are urged in favour of
restriction, and you will find only a paraphrase of the vulgar saying,—“<em class="e000I2">If no windows
were broken, what would the glaziers do?</em>”</p></div>

<p>The distinction thus established between immediate effects and
ultimate consequences, between surface appearances and substantial
realities, between <em class="e000I2">what we see and what we don’t see</em>, the author
proceeds, in the same happy vein, to apply to taxation, the proceeds
of which are said to come back to the labour-market like
refreshing showers,—to overgrown and unnecessary armaments,
and extravagant public works, which are defended as affording
employment to the working-classes,—to industrial and commercial
restrictions, which are justified on the same ground,—to the questions
of machinery, of credit, of colonization, of luxury and unproductive
consumption, etc. The entire work does not extend to
eighty pages, and in every one of its twelve short chapters Bastiat
demolishes a specious fallacy or a pernicious error.</p>

<p>But Bastiat had been for some time meditating a greater,
more elaborate, and more systematic work than any of those of
which we have hitherto spoken; and it is curious to trace in his
correspondence the progress of the ideas which were at length
developed in the <em class="e000I2">Harmonies Économiques</em>.
Writing to M. Coudroy in June 1845, he says—“If my little treatise
of the <em class="e000I2">Sophismes Économiques</em> is successful,
we may follow it up by another entitled <em class="e000I2">Harmonies
Sociales</em>. It would be of the greatest utility; for it would
meet the desires of an age in search of artificial harmonies and
organizations, by demonstrating the beauty, order, and progressive
principle of the natural and providential harmonies.” In June
1846, he writes to Mr Cobden, “I must bring out a second edition
of my <em class="e000I2">Sophismes</em>, and I should wish much to
write a little book to be entitled <em class="e000I2">Harmonies
Économiques</em>. It will be the counterpart of the other—the first
pulls down, the second will build up.” In another letter, written
the year after, he exclaims—“Oh, that the Divine Goodness would
give me yet one year of strength, and permit me to explain to my
young fellow-citizens what I regard as the true social theory, under
the twelve following heads:—<em class="e000I2">Wants</em>, <em
class="e000I2">production</em>, <em class="e000I2">property</em>, <em
class="e000I2">competition</em>, <em class="e000I2">population</em>,
<em class="e000I2">liberty</em>, <a id="p026"
class="xxpn">[p026]</a> <em class="e000I2">equality</em>,
<em class="e000I2">responsibility</em>, <em
class="e000I2">solidarity</em>, <em class="e000I2">fraternity</em>,
<em class="e000I2">unity</em>, <em class="e000I2">province of public
opinion</em>. I should then without regret, with joy, resign my life
into His hands!”</p>

<p>On the eve of being elected a Deputy to the National Assembly
in 1848, he writes from Mugron, “Here I am in my solitude. Would
that I could bury myself here for ever, and work out peacefully
this Economic synthesis which I have in my head, and which will
never leave it! For, unless there occur some sudden change in
public opinion, I am about to be sent to Paris charged with the
terrible mandate of a Representative of the People. If I had health
and strength, I should accept this mission with enthusiasm. But
what can my feeble voice, my sickly and nervous organization,
accomplish in the midst of revolutionary tempests? How much wiser
it had been to devote my last days to working out in silence the
great problem of the social destinies, for something tells me I
should have arrived at a solution! Poor village, humble home of my
fathers, I am about to bid you an eternal adieu; and I quit you
with the presentiment that my name and my life, lost amidst storms,
will not have even that modest utility for which you had prepared
me!”&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>In his letters to M. Coudroy at this period, we discover the same
idea working and fermenting in the mind of Bastiat, and struggling
for vent and utterance. Amid the anxieties and distractions in
which his duties as a Deputy involved him, he writes—“I am still
convinced that the practice of affairs excludes the possibility of
producing a work truly scientific, and yet I cannot conceal from
you that I always retain that old chimera of my <em class="e000I2">Social Harmonies</em>;
and I cannot divest myself of the thought that, if I had remained
with you, I should have succeeded in imparting to the world a
useful idea. I long much to make my retreat.” In another letter
to the same friend, after describing his feebleness, and intimating
his intention to leave Paris to try what effect a change to his
native air might produce, he adds—“I must renounce public life,
and all my ambition now is to have three or four months of tranquillity
to write my poor <em class="e000I2">Harmonies Économiques</em>. They are in
my head, but I fear they will never leave it.” “The crystal,” he
says elsewhere, “is formed drop by drop in silence and obscurity;
but retirement, quiet, time, freedom from care—all are wanting
to me.”</p>

<p>In April 1849, he writes again to M. Coudroy, “I have my
theory to work out, and powerful encouragements have reached
me opportunely. I read those words yesterday in an English
Review,—‘In Political Economy, the French school has had
<a id="p027" class="xxpn">[p027]</a> three phases, expressed by the three names, Quesnay, Say,
Bastiat.’ They assign me this rank and this part prematurely;
but it is certain that I have in my head a new and suggestive
idea, which I believe to be true. This idea I have never developed
methodically. It runs accidentally through some of my
articles, and as that has been enough to attract the attention of
the <em class="e000I2">savants</em>, and as it has already had the honour conferred on it
of being considered as forming an <em class="e000I2">epoch</em> in the science, I am certain
now that, when I give that theory in its complete state to the
world, it will at least be examined. Is not that all I could desire?
With what ardour I am about to turn to account my retirement in
order to elaborate that doctrine, certain as I am to have judges who
can understand it, and who are waiting for it!”</p>

<p>The three months of leisure, so long and so anxiously wished
for, came at last; and in the beginning of 1850 the <em class="e000I2">Harmonies</em> (or
rather the portions which the author had intended should form the
first volume of that work) made their appearance. The reception
of the work was not at first what might have been expected; and
Bastiat, again in Paris, writes to his friend M. Coudroy, “The
<em class="e000I2">Harmonies</em> pass unnoticed here, unless by some dozen connoisseurs.
I expected this—it could not be otherwise. I have not even in
my favour the wonted zeal of our own little circle, who accuse me
of heterodoxy; but in spite of this, I am confident that the book
will make its way by degrees. In Germany it has been very
differently received.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. I pray Heaven to vouchsafe me a
year to write the second volume; after which I shall sing, <em class="e000I2">Nunc
dimittis</em>.”</p>

<p>To Mr Cobden, in August 1850, he writes—“I went to my
native country to try to cure these unfortunate lungs, which are to
me very capricious servants. I have returned a little better, but
afflicted with a disease of the larynx, accompanied with a complete
extinction of voice. The doctor enjoins absolute silence; and, in
consequence, I am about to pass two months in the country, near
Paris. There I shall try to write the second volume of the
<em class="e000I2">Harmonies Économiques</em>. The first has been nearly unnoticed by
the learned world. I should not be an <em class="e000I2">author</em> if I gave in to that
judgment. I appeal to the future, for I am conscious that that
book contains an important idea, <em class="e000I2">une idée mère</em>, and time will come
to my assistance.”</p>

<p>This great work, the child of Bastiat’s anxious hopes, the subject
of his dying thoughts, although at first but coldly received, is
perhaps the most important and the most original contribution
which the science of Political Economy has received since the days
<a id="p028" class="xxpn">[p028]</a> of Adam Smith. On that most abstruse and difficult subject, the
first principles of Value, it opens up entirely new views; while on
almost every other branch of the subject, it either propounds a new
theory, or corrects and improves the nomenclature of the science.
Throughout, it treats Political Economy (and it is perhaps the
only work which does so, at least systematically) in connexion
with final causes, and demonstrates the Wisdom and Goodness of
God in the economy of civil society. On some questions we may
venture to differ from Bastiat. On the question of Rent, for
instance, he would seem to have followed too implicitly the theory
of Mr Carey, the able American Economist; but Bastiat’s work,
as a whole, has a freshness, a vigour, and an originality which all
must admire. He writes like a man thoroughly in earnest,—a
devout believer in the doctrines which he teaches, and he
seldom fails to carry conviction to the mind of his readers.
The leading idea of the work—the harmony of the social laws—is
admirable, and is admirably worked out. The motto of
the book, in fact, might have been the well-known lines of
Dryden,—</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p>From harmony, from heavenly harmony,</p>
      <p class="i03">This universal frame began:</p>
      <p class="i03">From harmony to harmony</p>
<p>Through all the compass of the notes it ran,</p>
<p>The diapason ending full in Man.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Bastiat undertakes to demonstrate the harmony of the Economic
laws,—that is to say, their tendency towards a common design,
which is the progressive improvement of the human race. He
proves convincingly that individual interests, taken in the aggregate,
far from being antagonistic, aid each other mutually; and
that, so far is it from being true that the gain of one is necessarily
the loss of another, each individual, each family, each country has
an interest in the prosperity of all others. He shows that, between
agriculturist and manufacturer, capitalist and labourer, producer
and consumer, native and foreigner, there is in reality no antagonism,
but, on the contrary, a community of interest; and that, in
order that the natural Economic laws should act constantly so as
to produce this result, one thing alone is necessary—namely,
respect for Liberty and Property. His design is best explained
in his own words: “I undertake in this work,” he says, “to
demonstrate the Harmony of those laws of Providence which
govern human society. What makes these laws harmonious and
not discordant is, that all principles, all motives, all springs of
action, all interests, co-operate towards a grand final result, which
humanity will never reach by reason of its native <em class="e000I2">imperfection</em>,
<a id="p029" class="xxpn">[p029]</a> but to which it will always approximate more and more by reason
of its unlimited <em class="e000I2">capability of improvement</em>. And that result is, the
indefinite approximation of all classes towards a level, which is
always rising; in other words, the <em class="e000I2">equalization</em> of individuals in
the general <em class="e000I2">amelioration</em>.”</p>

<p>Bastiat was not one of those pessimists who persist in looking
at the existing fabric of Society as if it were some ill-made,
ill-going clock, requiring constantly to be wound up, and to
have its springs adjusted, its wheels lubricated, and its hands
altered and set right. Far from this, he regarded Society as
a self-acting, self-regulating mechanism, bearing the stamp of
the Divine hand by which it was constructed, and subject to
laws and checks not less wise, not less immutable, not less trustworthy,
than the laws which govern the inanimate and material
world.</p>

<p>“God made the country, but man made the towns,” was the
exclamation of an amiable but a morbid poet. He might as well
have said—God made the blossom, but bees make the comb.
Reason asks, who then made the bees? Who made man, with
all his noble instincts, and admirable inventive reasoning and
reflective faculties?</p>

<p>A manlier, because a juster, philosophy enabled Bastiat rather
to say with Edmund Burke, “Art is man’s nature.” Looking at
the existing fabric and mechanism of Society, and the beautiful
harmony of the Economic laws which regulate it, he could see
nothing to warrant constant legislative tampering with the affairs
of trade. He had faith in moral and material progress under the
empire of Freedom. Sweeping away all Socialist Utopias and
artificial systems of social organization, he pointed to Society as it
exists, and exclaimed, <em class="e000I2">Digitus Dei est hic</em>. Unlike the sickly
poet, he believed that the same Good and Wise Being who created
both town and country, upholds and sustains them both; and
that the laws of Value and Exchange, left to their own free and
beneficent action, are as much His ordinance, as the laws of
motion, attraction, or chemical affinity.<a

<p>Engaged upon the second volume of the <em class="e000I2">Harmonies</em>, Bastiat
found his subject growing upon him, and discovered, as he
thought, when too late, that he had not in the first instance perceived
all its bearings. He felt, as he said, crushed by the mass
<a id="p030" class="xxpn">[p030]</a> of harmonies which presented themselves to him on every side;
and a posthumous note, found among his papers, informs us that
this expansion of his subject under his hand had led him to think
of recasting the entire work. “I had thought at first,” he says,
“to begin with the exposition of <em class="e000I2">Economic Harmonies</em>, and, consequently,
to treat only of subjects purely economical—<em class="e000I2">Value</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Property</em>, <em class="e000I2">Wealth</em>, <em class="e000I2">Competition</em>, <em class="e000I2">Wages</em>, <em class="e000I2">Population</em>, <em class="e000I2">Money</em>, <em class="e000I2">Credit</em>,
etc. Afterwards, if I had had time and strength, I should have
directed the attention of the reader to the larger subject of <em class="e000I2">Social
Harmonies</em>, and treated of the <em class="e000I2">Human Constitution</em>, <em class="e000I2">Social Motives</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Responsibility</em>, <em class="e000I2">Solidarity</em>, etc. The work thus conceived<a
href="#FN_11" id="FNa_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> had
been begun, when I saw that it was better to mingle together
than to separate these two classes of considerations. But then
logic required that the study of Man should precede the Economic
investigations; and—there was no longer time.”</p>

<p>Alas! the hours of Bastiat were numbered. He ran a desperate
steeple-chase with death, to use the expression of his biographer, and
he lost the day. His mind, his genius, shone as brightly, worked
as intensely, as ever; but the material frame-work was shattered
and in ruins. By the advice of his physicians, after resorting to
the waters of the Pyrenees without benefit, he repaired to Italy in
the autumn of 1850, and took up his residence at Pisa. Scarcely
had he arrived there, when he read in the newspapers a premature
announcement of his own death, and common-place expressions of
regret for the loss of the “great Economist” and “illustrious
author.” He wrote immediately to a friend to contradict the
report. “Thank God,” he says, “I am not dead, or even much
<a id="p031" class="xxpn">[p031]</a> worse. And yet if the news were true, I must just accept it and
submit. I wish all my friends could acquire in this respect the
philosophy I have myself acquired. I assure you I should breathe
my last without pain, and almost with joy, if I were certain of
leaving to the friends who love me, not poignant regrets, but a
gentle, affectionate, somewhat melancholy remembrance of me.”</p>

<p>After lingering some time at Pisa without improvement, he went
on to Rome. From Rome he writes to M. Coudroy—“Here I am
in the Eternal City, but not much disposed to visit its marvels.
I am infinitely better that I was at Pisa, surrounded as I am with
excellent friends.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. I should desire only one thing, to be
relieved of the acute pain which the disease of the windpipe
occasions. This continuity of suffering torments me. Every meal
is a punishment. To eat, drink, speak, cough, are all painful
operations. Walking fatigues me—carriage airings irritate the
throat—I can no longer work, or even read, seriously. You see
to what I am reduced. I shall soon be little better than a dead
body, retaining only the faculty of suffering.”&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. Even in
this state of extreme debility he was thinking of his favourite but
unfinished work. He adds, “If health is restored to me, and I
am enabled to complete the second volume of the <em class="e000I2">Harmonies</em>, I
shall dedicate it to you. If not, I shall prefix a short dedication
to the second edition of the first volume. On this last hypothesis,
which implies the end of my career, I can explain my plan, and
bequeath to you the task of fulfilling it.”</p>

<p>Bastiat’s career was in reality fast drawing to a close. His end
was calm and serene. He seemed himself to regard it as an
indifferent spectator, conversing with his friends on his favourite
topics,—Political Economy, Philosophy, and Religion. He desired
to die as a Christian. To his cousin the Abbé Monclar, and
his friend M. Paillottet, who stood by, he said—“On looking
around me, I observe that the most enlightened nations of the
world have been of the Christian faith, and I am very happy to
find myself in communion with that portion of the human race.”
“His eye,” says M. Paillottet, “sparkled with that peculiar expression
which I had frequently noticed in our conversations, and
which intimated the solution of a problem.” He beckoned his
friends to come near him, as if he had something to say to them—he
murmured twice the words <em class="e000I2">La verité</em>—and passed away.</p>

<p>His death took place at Rome, on the 24th of December 1850,
in the fiftieth year of his age. His obsequies were celebrated in
the church of Saint Louis des Français. It was in the year 1845
that he took up his residence in Paris, so that his career as an
<a id="p032" class="xxpn">[p032]</a> Economist had extended over little more than five years. He
died a martyr to his favourite science, and we may well apply to
him the beautiful lines of Lord Byron,—</p>


<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p>Oh! what a noble heart was here undone,</p>
<p>When Science’ self destroy’d her favourite son!</p>
<p>Yes, she too much indulged his fond pursuit,</p>
<p>She sow’d the seeds, but death has reap’d the fruit.</p>
<p>’Twas his own genius gave the final blow,</p>
<p>And help’d to plant the wound that laid him low:</p>
<p>So the struck eagle, stretch’d upon the plain,</p>
<p>No more through rolling clouds to soar again,</p>
<p>View’d his own feather on the fatal dart,</p>
<p>And wing’d the shaft that quiver’d in his heart;</p>
<p>Keen were his pangs, but keener far to feel</p>
<p>He nursed the pinion which impell’d the steel;</p>
<p>While the same plumage that had warm’d his nest</p>
<p>Drank the last life-drop of his bleeding breast.</p>

<a id="TO_THE_YOUTH_OF_FRANCE"></a>TO THE YOUTH OF FRANCE.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
Love of study, and lack of fixed opinions,—a mind free from prejudice,
a heart devoid of hate, zeal for the propagation of truth,—ardent
sympathies, disinterestedness, devotion, candour,—enthusiasm
for all that is good and fair, simple and great, honest and
religious,—such are the precious attributes of youth. It is for
this reason that I dedicate my work to you. And the seed must
have in it no principle of life if it fail to take root in a soil so
generous.</p>

<p>I had thought to offer you a picture, and all I have given you is
a sketch; but you will pardon me; for who, in times like the present,<a
href="#FN_12" id="FNa_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>
can sit down to finish a grave and important work? My
hope is that some one among you, on seeing it, will be led to
exclaim, with the great artist, <em class="e000I2">Anch’ io son pittore!</em> and, seizing
the pencil, impart to my rude canvas colour and flesh, light and
shade, sentiment and life.</p>

<p>You may think the title of the work somewhat ambitious; and
assuredly I make no pretension to reveal the designs of Providence
in the social order, and to explain the mechanism of all the forces
with which God has endowed man for the realization of progress.
All that I have aimed at is to put you on the right track, and
make you acquainted with the truth, that <em class="e000I2">all legitimate interests
are in harmony</em>. That is the predominant idea of my work, and
it is impossible not to recognise its importance.</p>

<p>For some time it has been the fashion to laugh at what has
been called the <em class="e000I2">social problem</em>: and no doubt some of the solutions
which have been proposed afford but too much ground for raillery.
But in the problem itself there is nothing laughable. It is the
ghost of Banquo at the feast of Macbeth—and no dumb ghost
either; for in formidable accents it calls out to terror-stricken
society—a solution or death! <a id="p034" class="xxpn">[p034]</a></p>

<p>Now this solution, you will at once see, must be different according
as men’s interests are held to be naturally harmonious or
naturally antagonistic.</p>

<p>In the one case, we must seek for the solution in Liberty—in
the other, in Constraint. In the one case, we have only to be
passive—in the other, we must necessarily offer opposition.</p>

<p>But Liberty assumes only one shape. Once convinced that
each of the molecules which compose a fluid possesses in itself the
force by which the general level is produced, we conclude that
there is no surer or simpler way of seeing that level realized than
not to interfere with it. All, then, who set out with this fundamental
principle, that <em class="e000I2">men’s interests are harmonious</em>, will agree as
to the practical solution of the social problem,—to abstain from
displacing or thwarting those interests.</p>

<p>Constraint, on the other hand, may assume a thousand shapes,
according to the views which we take of it, and which are infinitely
varied. Those schools which set out with, the principle,
that <em class="e000I2">men’s interests are antagonistic</em>, have done nothing yet towards
the solution of the problem, unless it be that they have thrust
aside Liberty. Among the infinite forms of Constraint, they have
still to choose the one which they consider good, if indeed any of
them be so. And then, as a crowning difficulty, they have to
obtain universal acceptance, among men who are free agents, for
the particular form of Constraint to which they have awarded the
preference.</p>

<p>But, on this hypothesis, if human interests are, by their very
nature, urged into fatal collision, and if this shock can be avoided
only by the accidental invention of an artificial social order, the
destiny of the human race becomes very hazardous, and we ask
in terror,</p>

<p>1st, If any man is to be found who has discovered a satisfactory
form of Constraint?</p>

<p>2d, Can this man bring to his way of thinking the innumerable
schools who give the preference to other forms?</p>

<p>3d, Will mankind give in to that particular form which, by
hypothesis, runs counter to all individual interests?</p>

<p>4th, Assuming that men will allow themselves to be rigged out
in this new attire, what will happen if another inventor presents
himself, with a coat of a different and improved cut? Are we to
persevere in a vicious organization, knowing it to be vicious; or
must we resolve to change that organization every morning according
as the caprices of fashion and the fertility of inventors’
brains may dictate? <a id="p035" class="xxpn">[p035]</a></p>

<p>5th, Would not all the inventors whose plans have been rejected
unite together against the particular organization which had
been selected, and would not their success in disturbing society
be in exact proportion to the degree in which that particular form
of organization ran counter to all existing interests?</p>

<p>6th, And, last of all, it may be asked, Does there exist any
human force capable of overcoming an antagonism which we presuppose
to be itself the very essence of human force?</p>

<p>I might multiply such questions <em class="e000I2">ad infinitum</em>, and propose, for
example, this difficulty:</p>

<p>If individual interest is opposed to the general interest, where
are we to place the active principle of Constraint? Where is the
fulcrum of the lever to be placed? Beyond the limits of human
society? It must be so if we are to escape the consequences of
your law. If we are to intrust some men with arbitrary power,
prove first of all that these men are formed of a different clay
from other mortals; that they in their turn will not be acted upon
by the fatal principle of self-interest; and that, placed in a situation
which excludes the idea of any curb, any effective opposition,
their judgments will be exempt from error, their hands from rapacity,
and their hearts from covetousness.</p>

<p>The radical difference between the various Socialist schools (I
mean here, those which seek the solution of the social problem
in an artificial organization) and the Economist school, does not
consist in certain views of detail or of governmental combination.
We encounter that difference at the starting point, in the preliminary
and pressing question—Are human interests, when left
to themselves, antagonistic or harmonious?</p>

<p>It is evident that the Socialists have set out in quest of an artificial
organization only because they judge the natural organization
of society bad or insufficient; and they have judged the latter bad
and insufficient, only because they think they see in men’s interests
a radical antagonism, for otherwise they would not have had recourse
to Constraint. It is not necessary to constrain into
harmony what is in itself harmonious.</p>

<p>Thus they have discovered antagonism everywhere:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p>Between the proprietor and the <em class="e000I2">prolétaire</em>;<a
href="#FN_13" id="FNa_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>
<p>Between capital and labour;</p>
<p>Between the masses and the <em class="e000I2">bourgeoisie</em>;</p>
<p>Between agriculture and manufactures;</p>
<p>Between the rustic and the burgess;</p>
<p>Between the native and the foreigner;</p>
<p>Between the producer and the consumer;</p>
<p>Between civilisation and organization;</p>
      <p class="i03">In a word,</p>
<p>Between Liberty and Harmony.</p>
</div></div>

<p>And this explains why it happens that, although a certain kind
of sentimental philanthropy finds a place in their hearts, gall and
bitterness flow continually from their lips. Each reserves all his
love for the new state of society he has dreamt of; but as regards
the society in which we actually live and move, it cannot, in their
opinion, be too soon crushed and overthrown, to make room for
the New Jerusalem they are to rear upon its ruins.</p>

<p>I have said that the <em class="e000I2">Economist</em> school, setting out with the
natural harmony of interests, is the advocate of Liberty.</p>

<p>And yet I must allow that if Economists in general stand up
for Liberty, it is unfortunately not equally true that their principles
establish solidly the foundation on which they build—the
harmony of interests.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further, and to forewarn you against the conclusions
which will no doubt be drawn from this avowal, I must
say a word on the situations which Socialism and Political
Economy respectively occupy.</p>

<p>It would be folly in me to assert that Socialism has never
lighted upon a truth, and that Political Economy has never fallen
into an error.</p>

<p>What separates, radically and profoundly, the two schools is
their difference of methods. The one school, like the astrologer
and the alchemist, proceeds on hypothesis; the other, like the
astronomer and the chemist, proceeds on observation.</p>

<p>Two astronomers, observing the same fact, may not be able to
arrive at the same result.</p>

<p>In spite of this transient disagreement, they feel themselves
united by the common process which sooner or later will cause
that disagreement to disappear. They recognise each other as of
the same communion. But between the astronomer, who observes,
and the astrologer, who imagines, the gulf is impassable, although
accidentally they may sometimes approximate.</p>

<p>The same thing holds of Political Economy and Socialism.</p>

<p>The Economists observe man, the laws of his organization, and
the social relations which result from those laws. The Socialists
conjure up an imaginary society, and then create a human heart
to suit that society. <a id="p037" class="xxpn">[p037]</a></p>

<p>Now, if philosophy never errs, philosophers often do. I deny
not that Economists may make false observations; I will add,
that they must necessarily begin by doing so.</p>

<p>But, then, what happens? If men’s interests are harmonious,
it follows that every incorrect observation will lead logically to
antagonism. What, then, are the Socialist tactics? They gather
from the works of Economists certain incorrect observations, follow
them out to their consequences, and show those consequences to
be disastrous. Thus far they are right. Then they set to work
upon the observer, whom we may assume to be Malthus or Ricardo.
Still they have right on their side. But they do not stop there.
They turn against the science of Political Economy itself, accusing
it of being heartless, and leading to evil. Here they do violence
to reason and justice, inasmuch as science is not responsible for
incorrect observation. At length they proceed another step. They
lay the blame on society itself:—they threaten to overthrow it for
the purpose of reconstructing the edifice:—and why? Because,
say they, it is proved by science that society as now constituted is
urged onwards to destruction. In this they outrage good sense—for
either science is not mistaken, and then why attack it?—or it
is mistaken, and in that case they should leave society in repose,
since society is not menaced.</p>

<p>But these tactics, illogical as they are, have not been the less
fatal to economic science, especially when the cultivators of that
science have had the misfortune, from a chivalrous and not unnatural
feeling, to render themselves liable, <em class="e000I2">singuli in solidum</em>, for
their predecessors and for one another. Science is a queen whose
gait should be frank and free:—the atmosphere of the <em class="e000I2">coterie</em> stifles
her.</p>

<p>I have already said that in Political Economy every erroneous
proposition must lead ultimately to antagonism. On the other
hand, it is impossible that the voluminous works of even the most
eminent economists should not include some erroneous propositions.
It is ours to mark and to rectify them in the interest of science
and of society. If we persist in maintaining them for the honour
of the fraternity, we shall not only expose ourselves, which is of
little consequence, but we shall expose truth itself, which is a
serious affair, to the attacks of Socialism.</p>

<p>To return: the conclusion of the Economists is for Liberty.
But in order that this conclusion should take hold of men’s minds
and hearts, it must be solidly based on this fundamental principle,
that interests, left to themselves, tend to harmonious combinations,
and to the progressive preponderance of the general good. <a id="p038" class="xxpn">[p038]</a></p>

<p>Now many Economists, some of them writers of authority, have
advanced propositions, which, step by step, lead logically to <em class="e000I2">absolute
evil</em>, necessary injustice, fatal and progressive inequality, and
inevitable pauperism, etc.</p>

<p>Thus, there are very few of them who, so far as I know, have
not attributed <em class="e000I2">value</em> to natural agents, to the gifts which God has
vouchsafed <em class="e000I2">gratuitously</em> to His creatures. The word <em class="e000I2">value</em> implies
that we do not give away the portion of it which we possess except
for an equivalent consideration. Here, then, we have men, especially
proprietors of land, bartering for effective labour the gifts
of God, and receiving recompense for utilities in the creation of
which their labour has had no share—an evident, but a necessary,
injustice, say these writers.</p>

<p>Then comes the famous theory of Ricardo, which may be summed
up in a few words: The price of the necessaries of life depends
on the labour required to produce them on the least productive
land in cultivation. Then the increase of population obliges us to
have recourse to soils of lower and lower fertility. Consequently
mankind at large (all except the landowners) are forced to give a
larger and larger amount of labour for the same amount of subsistence;
or, what comes to the same thing, to receive a less and less
amount of subsistence for the same amount of labour,—whilst the
landowners see their rentals swelling by every new descent to soils
of an inferior quality. Conclusion: Progressive opulence of men
of leisure—progressive poverty of men of labour; in other words,
fatal inequality.</p>

<p>Finally, we have the still more celebrated theory of Malthus, that
population has a tendency to increase more rapidly than the means
of subsistence, and that at every given moment of the life of man.
Now, men cannot be happy, or live in peace, if they have not the
means of support; and there are but two obstacles to this increase
of population which is always threatening us, namely, a diminished
number of births, or an increase of mortality in all its dreadful
forms. Moral restraint, to be efficacious, must be universal, and
no one expects that. There remains, then, only the repressive
obstacles—vice, poverty, war, pestilence, famine; in other words,
pauperism and death.</p>

<p>I forbear to mention other systems of a less general bearing,
which tend in the same way to bring us to a dead-stand. Monsieur
de Tocqueville, for example, and many others, tell us, if we
admit the right of primogeniture, we arrive at the most concentrated
aristocracy—if we do not admit it, we arrive at ruin and
sterility. <a id="p039" class="xxpn">[p039]</a></p>

<p>And it is worthy of remark, that these four melancholy theories
do not in the least decree run foul of each other. If they did, we
might console ourselves with the reflection that they are alike
false, since they refute each other. But no,—they are in unison,
and make part of one and the same general theory, which, supported
by numerous and specious facts, would seem to explain the
spasmodic state of modern society, and, fortified by the assent of
many masters in the science, presents itself with frightful authority
to the mind of the confused and discouraged inquirer.</p>

<p>We have still to discover how the authors of this melancholy
theory have been able to lay down, as their principle, the <em class="e000I2">harmony
of interests</em>, and, as their conclusion, Liberty.</p>

<p>For if mankind are indeed urged on by the laws of Value towards
Injustice,—by the laws of Rent towards Inequality,—by
the laws of Population towards Poverty,—by the laws of Inheritance
towards Sterility,—we can no longer affirm that God has
made the moral as He has made the natural world—a harmonious
work; we must bow the head and confess that it has pleased Him
to base it on revolting and irremediable dissonance.</p>

<p>You must not suppose, young men, that the Socialists have
refuted and repudiated what, in order to wound no one’s susceptibilities,
I shall call the theory of dissonances. No; let them say
as they will, they have assumed the truth of that theory, and it is
just because they have assumed its truth that they propose to
substitute Constraint for Liberty, artificial for natural organization,
their own inventions for the work of God. They say to their
opponents (and in this, perhaps, they are more consistent than the
latter),—if, as you have told us, human interests when left to
themselves tend to harmonious combination, we cannot do better
than welcome and magnify Liberty as you do. But you have
demonstrated unanswerably that those interests, if allowed to develop
themselves freely, urge mankind towards injustice, inequality,
pauperism, and sterility. Your theory, then, provokes reaction
precisely because it is true. We desire to break up the existing
fabric of society just because it is subject to the fatal laws which
you have described; we wish to make trial of our own powers,
seeing that the power of God has miscarried.</p>

<p>Thus they are agreed as regards the premises, and differ only
on the conclusion.</p>

<p>The Economists to whom I have alluded say that <em class="e000I2">the great providential
laws urge on society to evil</em>; but that we must take care
not to disturb the action of those laws, because such action is
happily impeded by the secondary laws which retard the final <a id="p040" class="xxpn">[p040]</a> catastrophe;
and arbitrary intervention can only enfeeble the embankment,
without stopping the fatal rising of the flood.</p>

<p>The Socialists say that <em class="e000I2">the great providential laws urge on society
to evil</em>; we must therefore abolish them, and select others from our
inexhaustible storehouse.</p>

<p>The Catholics say that <em class="e000I2">the great providential laws urge on society
to evil</em>; we must therefore escape from them by renouncing worldly
interests, and taking refuge in abnegation, sacrifice, asceticism,
and resignation.</p>

<p>It is in the midst of this tumult, of these cries of anguish and
distress, of these exhortations to subversion, or to resignation and
despair, that I endeavour to obtain a hearing for this assertion, in
presence of which, if it be correct, all difference of opinion must
disappear—<em class="e000I2">it is not true that the great providential laws urge on
society to evil</em>.</p>

<p>It is with reference to the conclusions to be deduced from their
common premises that the various schools are divided and combat
each other. I deny those premises, and I ask, Is not that the
best way of putting an end to these disputes?</p>

<p>The leading idea of this work, the harmony of interests, is <em class="e000I2">simple</em>.
Is simplicity not the touchstone of truth? The laws of light, of
sound, of motion, appear to us to be all the truer for being simple—Why
should it be otherwise with the law of interests?</p>

<p>This idea is <em class="e000I2">conciliatory</em>. What is more fitted to reconcile
parties than to demonstrate the harmony of the various branches
of industry: the harmony of classes, of nations, even of doctrines?</p>

<p>It is <em class="e000I2">consoling</em>, seeing that it points out what is false in those
systems which adopt, as their conclusion, progressive evil.</p>

<p>It is <em class="e000I2">religious</em>, for it assures us that it is not only the celestial
but the social mechanism which reveals the wisdom of God, and
declares His glory.</p>

<p>It is <em class="e000I2">practical</em>, for one can scarcely conceive anything more
easily reduced to practice than this,—to allow men to labour, to
exchange, to learn, to associate, to act and react on each other,—for,
according to the laws of Providence, nothing can result from
their intelligent spontaneity but order, harmony, progress, good,
and better still; better <em class="e000I2">ad infinitum</em>.</p>

<p>Bravo, you will say; here we have the optimism of the Economists
with a vengeance! These Economists are so much the slaves
of their own systems that they shut their eyes to facts for fear of
seeing them. In the face of all the poverty, all the injustice, all
the oppressions which desolate humanity, they coolly deny the
existence of evil. The smell of revolutionary gunpowder does not
<a id="p041" class="xxpn">[p041]</a> reach their blunted senses—the pavement of the barricades has
no voice for them; and were society to crumble to pieces before
their eyes, they would still keep repeating, “All is for the best in
the best of worlds.”</p>

<p>No indeed,—we do not think that all is for the best; but I have
faith in the wisdom of the laws of Providence, and for the same
reason I have faith in Liberty.</p>

<p>The question is, Have we Liberty?</p>

<p>The question is, Do these laws act in their plenitude, or is their
action not profoundly troubled by the countervailing action of
human institutions?</p>

<p>Deny evil! deny suffering! Who can? We must forget that
our subject is man. We must forget that we are ourselves men.
The laws of Providence may be regarded as harmonious without
their necessarily excluding evil. Enough that evil has its explanation
and its mission, that it checks and limits itself, that it
destroys itself by its own action, and that each suffering prevents
a greater suffering by repressing the cause of suffering.</p>

<p>Society has for its element man, who is a <em class="e000I2">free</em> agent; and since
man is free, he may choose,—since he may choose, he may be mistaken,—since
he may be mistaken, he may suffer.</p>

<p>I go further. I say he must be mistaken and suffer—for he begins
his journey in ignorance, and for ignorance there are endless
and unknown roads, all of which, except one, lead to error.</p>

<p>Now, every Error engenders suffering; but either suffering reacts
upon the man who errs, and then it brings Responsibility into
play,—or, if it affects others who are free from error, it sets in motion
the marvellous reactionary machinery of Solidarity.</p>

<p>The action of these laws, combined with the faculty which has
been vouchsafed to us of connecting effects with their causes,
must bring us back, by means of this very suffering, into the way
of what is good and true.</p>

<p>Thus, not only do we not deny the existence of evil, but we
acknowledge that it has a mission in the social, as it has in the
material world.</p>

<p>But, in order that it should fulfil this mission, we must not
stretch Solidarity artificially, so as to destroy Responsibility,—in
other words, we must respect Liberty.</p>

<p>Should human institutions step in to oppose in this respect the
divine laws, evil would not the less flow from error, only it would
shift its position. It would strike those whom it ought not to
strike. It would be no longer a warning and a monitor. It would
no longer have the tendency to diminish and die away by its own
<a id="p042" class="xxpn">[p042]</a> proper action. Its action would be continued, and increase, as
would happen in the physiological world if the imprudences and
excesses of the men of one hemisphere were felt in their unhappy
effects only by the inhabitants of the opposite hemisphere.</p>

<p>Now this is precisely the tendency not only of most of our governmental
institutions, but likewise, and above all, of those which
we seek to establish as remedies for the evils which we suffer.
Under the philanthropical pretext of developing among men a factitious
Solidarity, we render Responsibility more and more inert
and inefficacious. By an improper application of the public force,
we alter the relation of labour to its remuneration, we disturb the
laws of industry and of exchange, we offer violence to the natural
development of education, we give a wrong direction to capital and
labour, we twist and invert men’s ideas, we inflame absurd pretensions,
we dazzle with chimerical hopes, we occasion a strange loss
of human power, we change the centres of population, we render
experience itself useless,—in a word, we give to all interests artificial
foundations, we set them by the ears, and then we exclaim
that—Interests are antagonistic: Liberty has done all the evil,—let
us denounce and stifle Liberty.</p>

<p>And yet, as this sacred word has still power to stir men’s hearts
and make them palpitate, we despoil Liberty of its <em class="e000I2">prestige</em> by depriving
it of its name, and it is under the title of <em class="e000I2">Competition</em> that
the unhappy victim is led to the sacrificial altar, amid the applause
of a mob stretching forth their hands to receive the shackles of
servitude.</p>

<p>It is not enough, then, to exhibit, in their majestic harmony, the
natural laws of the social order; we must also explain the disturbing
causes which paralyze their action; and this is what I have
endeavoured to do in the second part of this work.</p>

<p>I have striven to avoid controversy; and, in doing so, I have
no doubt lost an opportunity of giving to the principles which I
desire to disseminate the stability which results from a thorough
and searching discussion. And yet, might not the attention of the
reader, seduced by digressions, have been diverted from the argument
taken as a whole? If I exhibit the edifice as it stands, what
matters it in what light it has been regarded by others, even by
those who first taught me to look at it?</p>

<p>And now I would appeal with confidence to men of all schools,
who prefer truth, justice, and the public good to their own systems.</p>

<p>Economists! like you, I am the advocate of <em class="e00S02">Liberty</em>; and if I
succeed in shaking some of those premises which sadden your
generous hearts, perhaps you will see in this an additional incentive
to love and to serve our sacred cause. <a id="p043" class="xxpn">[p043]</a></p>

<p>Socialists! you have faith in <em class="e00S02">Association</em>. I conjure you, after
having read this book, to say whether society as it is now constituted,
apart from its abuses and shackles, that is to say, under the
condition of Liberty, is not the most beautiful, the most complete,
the most durable, the most universal, the most equitable, of all
Associations.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Egalitaires!</em> you admit but one principle, the <em class="e00S02">Mutuality of
Services</em>. Let human transactions be free, and I assert that they
are not and cannot be anything else than a reciprocal exchange of
<em class="e000I2">services</em>,—services always diminishing in <em class="e000I2">value</em>, always increasing
in <em class="e000I2">utility</em>.</p>

<p>Communists! you desire that men, become brothers, should enjoy
in common the goods which Providence has lavished on them.
My aim is to demonstrate that society as it exists has only to acquire
freedom in order to realize and surpass your wishes and your
hopes. For all things are common to all, on the single condition
that each man takes the trouble to gather what God has given,
which is very natural; or remunerate freely those who take that
trouble for him, which is very just.</p>

<p>Christians of all communions! unless you stand alone in casting
doubt on the divine wisdom, manifested in the most magnificent of
all God’s works which have come within the range of our knowledge,
you will find in this book no expression which can shock
the severest morals, or the most mysterious dogmas of your faith.</p>

<p>Proprietors! whatever be the extent of your possessions, if I
establish that your rights, now so much contested, are limited, like
those of the most ordinary workman, to the receiving of services
in exchange for real and substantial services which have been actually
rendered by you, or by your forefathers, those rights will
henceforth repose on a basis which cannot lie shaken.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Prolétaires!</em> men who live by wages! I undertake to demonstrate
that you obtain the fruits of the land of which you are not
the owners with less pain and effort than if you were obliged to
raise those fruits by your own direct labour,—with less than if
that land had been given to you in its primitive state, and before
being prepared for cultivation by labour.</p>

<p>Capitalists and labourers! I believe myself in a position to
establish the law that, in proportion as capital is accumulated, the
<em class="e000I2">absolute</em> share of the total product falling to the capitalist increases,
and his <em class="e000I2">proportional</em> share is diminished; while both the <em class="e000I2">absolute</em>
and <em class="e000I2">relative</em> share of the product falling to the labourer is augmented,—the
reverse effects being produced when capital is lessened or
dissipated.<a
href="#FN_14" id="FNa_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> If this law be established, the obvious deduction is,
<a id="p044" class="xxpn">[p044]</a> a harmony of interests between labourers and those who employ
them.</p>

<p>Disciples of Malthus! sincere and calumniated philanthropists,
whose only fault has been in warning mankind against the effects
of a law which you believe to be fatal, I shall have to submit to
you another law more reassuring:—“<em class="e000I2">Cæteris paribus</em>, increasing
density of population is equivalent to increasing facility of production.”
And if it be so, I am certain it will not be you who will
grieve to see a stumbling-block removed from the threshold of our
favourite science.</p>

<p>Men of spoliation! you who, by force or fraud, by law or in
spite of law, batten on the people’s substance; you, who live by
the errors you propagate, by the ignorance you cherish, by the
wars you light up, by the trammels with which you hamper trade;
you who tax labour after having rendered it unproductive, making
it lose a sheaf for every handful you yourselves pluck from it; you
who cause yourselves to be paid for creating obstacles, in order to
get afterwards paid for partially removing those obstacles; incarnations
of egotism in its worst sense; parasitical excrescences of a
vicious policy, prepare for the sharpest and most unsparing criticism.
To you alone I make no appeal, for the design of this book is to
sacrifice you, or rather to sacrifice your unjust pretensions. In
vain we cherish conciliation. There are two principles which can
never be reconciled—Liberty and Constraint.</p>

<p>If the laws of Providence are harmonious, it is when they act
with freedom, without which there is no harmony. Whenever,
then, we remark an absence of harmony, we may be sure that it proceeds
from an absence of liberty, an absence of justice. Oppressors,
spoliators, contemners of justice, you can have no part in the universal
harmony, for it is you who disturb it.</p>

<p>Do I mean to say that the effect of this work may be to enfeeble
power, to shake its stability, to diminish its authority? My design
is just the opposite. But let me not be misunderstood.</p>

<p>It is the business of political science to distinguish between what
ought and what ought not to fall under State control; and in making
this important distinction we must not forget that the State
always acts through the intervention of Force. The services which
it renders us, and the services which it exacts from us in return, are
alike imposed upon us under the name of contributions. <a id="p045" class="xxpn">[p045]</a></p>

<p>The question then comes back to this: What are the things
which men have a right to impose upon each other <em class="e000I2">by force</em>? Now,
I know but one thing in this situation, and that is <em class="e000I2">Justice</em>. I have
no right to <em class="e000I2">force</em> any one whatever to be religious, charitable, well
educated, or industrious; but I have a right to <em class="e000I2">force</em> him to be <em class="e000I2">just</em>,—this
is a case of legitimate defence.</p>

<p>Now, individuals in the aggregate can possess no right which did
not pre-exist in individuals as such. If, then, the employment of
individual force is justified only by legitimate defence, the fact that
the action of government is always manifested by Force should lead
us to conclude that it is essentially limited to the maintenance of
order, security, and justice.</p>

<p>All action of governments beyond this limit is a usurpation upon
conscience, upon intelligence, upon industry; in a word, upon
human liberty.</p>

<p>This being granted, we ought to set ourselves unceasingly and
without compunction to emancipate the entire domain of private
enterprise from the encroachments of power. Without this we
shall not have gained Freedom, or the free play of those laws of
harmony which God has provided for the development and progress
of the human race.</p>

<p>Will Power by this means be enfeebled? Will it have lost in
stability because it has lost in extent? Will it have less authority
because it has fewer functions to discharge? Will it attract to
itself less respect because it calls forth fewer complaints? Will it
be more the sport of factions, when it has reduced those enormous
budgets and that coveted influence which are the baits and allurements
of faction? Will it encounter greater danger when it has
less responsibility?</p>

<p>To me it seems evident, that to confine public force to its one,
essential, undisputed, beneficent mission,—a mission desired and
accepted by all,—would be the surest way of securing to it respect
and universal support. In that case, I see not whence could proceed
systematic opposition, parliamentary struggles, street insurrections,
revolutions, sudden changes of fortune, factions, illusions, the pretensions
of all to govern under all forms, those dangerous and
absurd systems which teach the people to look to government for
everything, that compromising diplomacy, those wars which are
always in perspective, or armed truces which are nearly as fatal,
those crushing taxes which it is impossible to levy on any equitable
principle, that absorbing and unnatural mixing up of politics with
everything, those great artificial displacements of capital and
labour, which are the source of fruitless heartburnings, fluctuations,
stoppages, and commercial crises. All these causes of trouble, of
<a id="p046" class="xxpn">[p046]</a> irritation, of disaffection, of covetousness, and of disorder, and a
thousand others, would no longer have any foundation, and the
depositaries of power, instead of disturbing, would contribute to the
universal harmony,—a harmony which does not indeed exclude
evil, but which leaves less and less room for those ills which are
inseparable from the ignorance and perversity of our feeble nature,
and whose mission it is to prevent or chastise that ignorance and
perversity.</p>

<p>Young men! in these days in which a grievous Scepticism would
seem to be at once the effect and the punishment of the anarchy of
ideas which prevails, I shall esteem myself happy if this work, as
you proceed in its perusal, should bring to your lips the consoling
words, <em class="e00S02">I believe</em>,—words of a sweet-smelling savour, which are at
once a refuge and a force, which are said to remove mountains, and
stand at the head of the Christian’s creed—I believe. “I believe,
not with a blind and submissive faith, for we are not concerned
here with the mysteries of revelation, but with a rational and scientific
faith, befitting things which are left to man’s investigation.—I
believe that He who has arranged the material universe has not
withheld His regards from the arrangements of the social world.—I
believe that He has combined, and caused to move in harmony,
free agents as well as inert molecules.—I believe that His overruling
Providence shines forth as strikingly, if not more so, in the
laws to which He has subjected men’s interests and men’s wills, as
in the laws which He has imposed on weight and velocity.—I
believe that everything in human society, even what is apparently
injurious, is the cause of improvement and of progress.—I believe
that Evil tends to Good, and calls it forth, whilst Good cannot tend
to Evil; whence it follows that Good must in the end predominate.—I
believe that the invincible social tendency is a constant approximation
of men towards a common moral, intellectual, and physical
level, with, at the same time, a progressive and indefinite elevation
of that level.—I believe that all that is necessary to the gradual
and peaceful development of humanity is that its tendencies should
not be disturbed, but have the liberty of their movements restored.—I
believe these things, not because I desire them, not because
they satisfy my heart, but because my judgment accords to them a
deliberate assent.”</p>

<p>Ah! whenever you come to pronounce these words, <em
class="e00S02">I believe</em>, you will be anxious to propagate
your creed, and the social problem will soon be resolved, for,
let them say what they will, it is not of difficult solution.
Men’s interests are harmonious,—the solution, then, lies entirely
in this one word—<em class="e00S02">Liberty</em>. <a id="p047"

<p class="chapterhead">
Is it quite certain that the mechanism of society, like the
mechanism of the heavenly bodies, or that of the human frame,
is subject to general laws? Does it form a harmoniously <em
class="e000I2">organized</em> whole? Or rather, do we not remark in
it the absence of all <em class="e000I2">organization</em>? Is not an
<em class="e000I2">organization</em> the very thing which all men of
heart and of the future, all advanced publicists, all the pioneers
of thought, are in search of at the present day? Is society anything
else than a multitude of individuals placed in juxtaposition, acting
without concert, and given up to the movements of an anarchical
liberty? Are our countless masses, after having with difficulty
recovered their liberties one after the other, not now awaiting
the advent of some great genius to arrange them into a harmonious
whole? Having pulled down all, must we not now set about laying the
foundation of a new edifice.</p>

<p>And yet, it may be asked, have these questions any other meaning
than this: Can society dispense with written laws, rules, and
repressive measures? Is every man to make an unlimited use of
his faculties, even when in so doing he strikes at the liberties of
<a id="p048" class="xxpn">[p048]</a> another, or inflicts injury on society at large? In a word, must
we recognise in the maxim, <em class="e000I2">laissez faire, laissez passer</em>, the absolute
formula of political economy? If that were the question, no one
could hesitate about the solution. The economists do not say that
a man may kill, sack, burn, and that society has only to be quiescent,—<em class="e000I2">laisser
faire</em>. They say that even in the absence of all law,
society would resist such acts; and that consequently such resistance
is a general law of humanity. They say that civil and penal
laws must regulate, and not counteract, those general laws the
existence of which <em class="e000I2">they presuppose</em>. There is a wide difference
between a social organization, founded on the general laws of human
nature, and an artificial organization, invented, imagined,—which
takes no account of these laws, or repudiates and despises them,—such
an organization, in short, as many modern schools would
impose upon us.</p>

<p>For, if there be general laws which act independently of written
laws, and of which the latter can only regulate the action, we must
study these <em class="e000I2">general laws</em>. They can be made the object of a science,
and Political Economy exists. If, on the other hand, society is a
human invention, if men are regarded only as inert matter, to which
a great genius, like Rousseau, must impart sentiment and will, movement
and life, then there is no such science as Political Economy.
There are only an indefinite number of possible and contingent
arrangements, and the fate of nations must depend upon the <em class="e000I2">Founder</em>
to whom chance shall have committed their destinies.</p>

<p>In order to prove that society is subject to general laws, no elaborate
dissertation is necessary. All I shall do is to notice certain
facts, which, although trite, are not the less important.</p>

<p>Rousseau has said, <em class="e000I2">Il faut beaucoup de philosophie pour observer
les faits qui sont trop près de nous</em>—“Much philosophy is needed
to observe accurately things which are too near us.” And
such are the social phenomena in the midst of which we live
and move. Habit has so familiarized us with these phenomena
that we cease to observe them, unless something striking and exceptional
forces them on our attention.</p>

<p>Let us take, by way of illustration, a man in the humble walks
of life—a village carpenter, for instance,—and observe the various
services he renders to society, and receives from it; we shall not fail
to be struck with the enormous disproportion which is apparent.</p>

<p>This man employs his day’s labour in planing boards, and making
tables and chests of drawers. He complains of his condition;
yet in truth what does he receive from society in exchange for his
work? <a id="p049" class="xxpn">[p049]</a></p>

<p>First of all, on getting up in the morning, he dresses himself;
and he has himself personally made none of the numerous articles
of which his clothing consists. Now, in order to put at his disposal
this clothing, simple as it is, an enormous amount of labour,
industry, and locomotion, and many ingenious inventions, must
have been employed. Americans must have produced cotton,
Indians indigo, Frenchmen wool and flax, Brazilians hides; and
all these materials must have been transported to various towns
where they have been worked up, spun, woven, dyed, etc.</p>

<p>Then he breakfasts. In order to procure him the bread which
he eats every morning, land must have been cleared, enclosed,
laboured, manured, sown; the fruits of the soil must have been
preserved with care from pillage, and security must have reigned
among an innumerable multitude of people; the wheat must have
been cut down, ground into flour, kneaded, and prepared; iron,
steel, wood, stone, must have been converted by industry into
instruments of labour; some men must have employed animal
force, others water power, etc.; all matters, of which each, taken
singly, presupposes a mass of labour, whether we have regard to
space or time, of incalculable amount.</p>

<p>In the course of the day this man will have occasion to use
sugar, oil, and various other materials and utensils.</p>

<p>He sends his son to school, there to receive an education, which,
although limited, nevertheless implies anterior study and research,
and an extent of knowledge which startles the imagination.</p>

<p>He goes out. He finds the street paved and lighted.</p>

<p>A neighbour goes to law with him. He finds advocates to
plead his cause, judges to maintain his rights, officers of justice
to put the sentence in execution; all which implies acquired
knowledge, and, consequently, intelligence and means of subsistence.</p>

<p>He goes to church. It is a stupendous monument, and the book
which he carries thither is a monument perhaps still more stupendous,
of human intelligence. He is taught morals, he has his
mind enlightened, his soul elevated; and in order to this we must
suppose that another man had previously frequented schools and
libraries, consulted all the sources of human learning, and while
so employed had been able to live without occupying himself
directly with the wants of the body.</p>

<p>If our artizan undertakes a journey, he finds that, in order to
save him time and exertion, other men have removed and levelled
the soil, filled up valleys, hewed down mountains, united the banks
of rivers, diminished friction, placed wheeled carriages on blocks
<a id="p050" class="xxpn">[p050]</a> of sandstone or bands of iron, and brought the force of animals and
the power of steam into subjection to human wants.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to be struck with the measureless disproportion
which exists between the enjoyments which this man derives
from society and what he could obtain by his own unassisted exertions.
I venture to say that in a single day he consumes more
than he could himself produce in ten centuries.</p>

<p>What renders the phenomenon still more strange is, that all
other men are in the same situation. Every individual member
of society has absorbed millions of times more than he could himself
produce; yet there is no mutual robbery. And, if we regard
things more nearly, we perceive that the carpenter has paid, in
services, for all the services which others have rendered to him.
If we bring the matter to a strict reckoning, we shall be convinced
that he has received nothing which he has not paid for by means of
his modest industry; and that every one who, at whatever interval
of time or space, has been employed in his service has received,
or will receive, his remuneration.</p>

<p>The social mechanism, then, must be very ingenious and very
powerful, since it leads to this singular result, that each man,
even he whose lot is cast in the humblest condition, has more
enjoyment in one day than he could himself produce in many
ages.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. The mechanism of society will appear still
more ingenious, if the reader will be pleased to turn his regards
upon himself.</p>

<p>I suppose him a plain student. What is his business in Paris?
How does he live? It cannot be disputed that society places at
his disposal food, clothing, lodging, amusements, books, means of
instruction, a multitude of things, in short, which would take a
long time not only to produce, but even to explain how they were
produced. And what services has this student rendered to society
in return for all these things which have exacted so much labour,
toil, fatigue, physical and intellectual effort, so many inventions,
transactions, and conveyances hither and thither? None at all.
He is only preparing to render services. Why, then, have so
many millions of men abandoned to him the fruits of their positive,
effective, and productive labour? Here is the explanation:—The
father of this student, who was a lawyer, perhaps, or a physician,
or a merchant, had formerly rendered services—it may be to society
in China,—and had been remunerated, not by immediate services,
but by a <em class="e000I2">title</em> to demand services, at the time, in the place and
under the form that might be most suitable and convenient to him.
<a id="p051" class="xxpn">[p051]</a> It is of these past and distant services that society is now acquitting
itself, and (astonishing as it seems) if we follow in thought the infinite
range of transactions which must have had place in order to
this result being effected, we shall see that every one has been
remunerated for his labour and services; and that these <em class="e000I2">titles</em> have
passed from hand to hand, sometimes divided into parts, sometimes
grouped together, until, in the consumption of this student, the
entire account has been squared and balanced. Is not this a very
remarkable phenomenon?</p>

<p>We should shut our eyes to the light of day, did we fail to
perceive that society could not present combinations so complicated,
and in which civil and penal laws have so little part, unless it
obeyed the laws of a mechanism wonderfully ingenious. The
study of that mechanism is the business of <em class="e000I2">Political Economy</em>.</p>

<p>Another thing worthy of observation is, that of the incalculable
number of transactions to which the student owed his daily subsistence,
there was not perhaps a millionth part which contributed
to it directly. The things of which he has now the enjoyment,
and which are innumerable, were produced by men the greater
part of whom have long since disappeared from the earth. And
yet they were remunerated as they expected to be, although he
who now profits by the fruits of their labours had done nothing for
them. They knew him not; they will never know him. He who
reads this page, at the very moment he is reading it, has the power,
although perhaps he has no consciousness of it, to put in motion
men of every country, of all races, I had almost said of all time—white,
black, red, tawny—to make bygone generations, and
generations still unborn, contribute to his present enjoyments;
and he owes this extraordinary power to the services which his
father had formerly rendered to other men, who apparently had
nothing in common with those whose labour is now put in requisition.
Yet despite all differences of time and space, so just
and equitable a balance has been struck, that every one has been
remunerated, and has received exactly what he calculated he
ought to receive.</p>

<p>But, in truth, could all this have happened, and such phenomena
been witnessed, unless society had had a natural and wise <em class="e000I2">organization</em>,
which acts, as it were, unknown to us?</p>

<p>Much has been said in our day of inventing a new <em class="e000I2">organization</em>.
Is it quite certain, that any thinker, whatever genius we may attribute
to him, whatever power we may suppose him to possess,
could imagine and introduce an organization superior to that of
which I have just sketched some of the results? <a id="p052" class="xxpn">[p052]</a></p>

<p>But what would be thought of it if I described its machinery,
its springs, and its motive powers?</p>

<p>The machinery consists of men, that is to say, of beings capable
of learning, reflecting, reasoning, of being deceived and undeceived,
and consequently of contributing to the amelioration or deterioration
of the mechanism itself. They are capable of pleasure and
pain; and it is that which makes them not only the wheels but
the springs of the mechanism. They are also the motive power;
for it is in them that the active principle resides. More than that,
they are themselves the very end and object of the mechanism,
since it is into individual pains and enjoyments that the whole
definitely resolves itself.</p>

<p>Now it has been remarked, and it is unhappily obvious enough,
that in the action, the development, and even the progress (by
those who acknowledge progress) of this powerful mechanism,
many of the wheels have been inevitably, fatally injured; and
that, as regards a great number of human beings, the sum of unmerited
suffering surpasses by much the sum of enjoyment.</p>

<p>This view of the subject has led many candid minds, many
generous hearts, to suspect the mechanism itself. They have repudiated
it, they have refused to study it, they have attacked, often
with passion, those who have investigated and explained its laws.
They have risen against the nature of things, and at length they
have proposed to <em class="e000I2">organize</em> society upon a new plan, in which injustice
and suffering and error shall have no place.</p>

<p>God forbid that I should set myself against intentions manifestly
pure and philanthropical! But I should desert my principles,
and do violence to the dictates of my own conscience, did
I not declare that these men are in my opinion upon a wrong
path.</p>

<p>In the first place, they are reduced, by the very nature of their
propagandism, to the melancholy necessity of disowning the good
which society develops, of denying its progress, of imputing to it
all sufferings, of hunting after these with avidity, and exaggerating
them beyond measure.</p>

<p>When a man believes that he has discovered a social organization
different from that which results from the ordinary tendencies
of human nature, it is quite necessary, in order to obtain acceptance
for his invention, to paint the organization he wishes to
abolish in the most sombre colours. Thus the publicists to whom
I am alluding, after having proclaimed enthusiastically, and perhaps
with exaggeration, the perfectibility of man, fall into the
strange contradiction of maintaining that society is becoming more
<a id="p053" class="xxpn">[p053]</a> and more deteriorated. According to them, men are a thousand
times more unhappy than they were in ancient times under the
feudal <em class="e000I2">régime</em>, and the yoke of slavery. The world is become a
hell. Were it possible to conjure up the Paris of the tenth
century, I venture to think that such a thesis would be found untenable.</p>

<p>Then they are led to condemn the very mainspring of human
action—I mean a regard to <em class="e000I2">personal interest</em>, because it has brought
about such a state of things. Let us remark that man is so
organized as to seek for enjoyment and avoid suffering. From this
source I allow that all social evils take their rise—war, slavery,
monopoly, privilege; but from the same source springs all that is
good, since the satisfaction of wants and repugnance to suffering
are the motives of human action. The business then is to discover
whether this incitement to action, by its universality—from
individual becoming social—is not in itself a principle of
progress.</p>

<p>At all events, do the inventors of new organizations not perceive
that this principle, inherent in the very nature of man, will follow
them into their systems, and that there it will make greater havoc
than in our natural organization, in which the interest and unjust
pretensions of one are at least restrained by the resistance of all?
These writers always make two inadmissible suppositions—the
first is, that society, such as they conceive it, will be directed
by infallible men denuded of this motive of self-interest; and,
secondly, that the masses will allow themselves to be directed by
these men.</p>

<p>Finally, these system-makers appear to give themselves no
trouble about the means of execution. How are they to establish
their system? How are they to induce all mankind at once to
give up the principle upon which they now act—the attraction of
enjoyment, and the repugnance to pain? It would be necessary,
as Rousseau has said, <em class="e000I2">to change the moral and physical constitution
of man</em>.</p>

<p>In order to induce men at once to throw aside, as a worn-out
garment, the existing social order in which the human race has
lived and been developed from the beginning to our day, to adopt
an organization of human invention and become docile parts of
another mechanism, there are, it seems to me, only two means
which can be employed—Force, or Universal Consent.</p>

<p>The founder of the new system must have at his disposal a
force capable of overcoming all resistance, so that humanity shall
be in his hands only as so much melting wax to be moulded and
<a id="p054" class="xxpn">[p054]</a> fashioned at his pleasure—or he must obtain by persuasion an
assent so complete, so exclusive, so blind even, as to render unnecessary
the employment of force.</p>

<p>I defy any one to point out to me a third means of establishing
or introducing into human practice a <em class="e000I2">Phalanstère</em>,<a
href="#FN_16" id="FNa_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> or any other
artificial social organization.</p>

<p>Now, if there be only two assumed means, and if we have demonstrated
that the one is as impracticable as the other, we have
proved that these system-makers are losing both their time and
their trouble.</p>

<p>As regards the disposal of a material force which should subject
to them all the kings and peoples of the earth, this is what these
dotards, senile as they are, have never dreamt of. King Alphonsus
had presumption and folly enough to exclaim, that “If he had
been taken into God’s counsels, the planetary system should have
been better arranged.” But although he set his <em class="e000I2">wisdom</em> above
that of the Creator, he was not mad enough to wish to struggle
with the <em class="e000I2">power</em> of Omnipotence, and history does not tell us that
he ever actually tried to make the stars turn according to the laws
of his invention. Descartes likewise contented himself with constructing
a tiny world with dice and strings, knowing well that he
was not <em class="e000I2">strong</em> enough to remove the universe. We know no one
but Xerxes who, in the intoxication of his power, dared to say to
the waves, “Thus far shall ye come, and no farther.” The billows
did not recede before Xerxes, but Xerxes retreated before the billows;
and without this humiliating but wise precaution he would
certainly have been drowned.</p>

<p>Force, then, is wanting to the organizers who would subject
humanity to their experiments. When they shall have gained
over to their cause the Russian autocrat, the shah of Persia, the
khan of Tartary, and all the other tyrants of the world, they will
find that they still want the power to distribute mankind into
groups and classes, and to annihilate the general laws of property,
exchange, inheritance, and family; for even in Russia, in Persia,
and in Tartary, it is necessary to a certain extent to consult the
feelings, habits, and prejudices of the people. Were the emperor
of Russia to take it into his head to set about <em class="e000I2">altering the moral
and physical constitution of his subjects</em>, it is probable that he would
soon have a successor, and that his successor would be better advised
than to pursue the experiment.</p>

<p>But since <em class="e000I2">force</em> is a means quite beyond the reach of our
<a id="p055" class="xxpn">[p055]</a> numerous system-makers, no other resource remains to them but to
obtain <em class="e000I2">universal consent</em>.</p>

<p>There are two modes of obtaining this—namely, Persuasion and
Imposture.</p>

<p>Persuasion! but have we ever found two minds in perfect accord
upon all the points of a single science? How then are we to expect
men of various tongues, races, and manners, spread over the
surface of the globe, most of them unable to read, and destined to
die without having even heard the name of the <em class="e000I2">reformer</em>, to accept
with unanimity the universal science? What is it that you aim
at? At changing the whole system of labour, exchanges, and
social relations, domestic, civil, and religious; in a word, at altering
the whole physical and moral constitution of man; and you
hope to rally mankind, and bring them all under this new order of
things, by conviction!</p>

<p>Verily you undertake no light or easy duty.</p>

<p>When a man has got the length of saying to his fellows:</p>

<p>“For the last five thousand years there has been a misunderstanding
between God and man;</p>

<p>“From the days of Adam to our time, the human race have been
upon a wrong course—and, if only a little confidence is placed in
me. I shall soon bring them back to the right way;</p>

<p>“God desired mankind to pursue a different road altogether, but
they have taken their own way, and hence evil has been introduced
into the world. Let them turn round at my call, and
take an opposite direction, and universal happiness will then
prevail.”</p>

<p>When a man sets out in this style it is much if he is believed
by five or six adepts; but between that and being believed by one
thousand millions of men the distance is great indeed.</p>

<p>And then, remember that the number of social inventions is as
vast as the domain of the imagination itself; that there is not a
publicist or writer on social economy who, after shutting himself
up for a few hours in his library, does not come forth with a ready-made
plan of artificial organization in his hand; that the inventions
of Fourier, Saint Simon, Owen, Cabet, Blanc, etc., have no resemblance
whatever to each other; that every day brings to light a new
scheme; and that people are entitled to have some little time given
them for reflection before they are called upon to reject the social
organization which God has vouchsafed them, and to make a
definite and irrevocable choice among so many newly invented
systems. For what would happen if, after having selected one of
these plans, a better should present itself! Can the institutions
<a id="p056" class="xxpn">[p056]</a> of property, family, labour, exchange, be placed every day upon a
new basis? Are we to be forced to change the organization of
society every morning?</p>

<p>“Thus, then,” says Rousseau, “the legislator being able to
employ effectively neither force nor persuasion, he is under the
necessity of having recourse to an authority of another kind, which
carries us along without violence, and persuades without convincing
us.”</p>

<p>What is that authority? Imposture. Rousseau dares not give
utterance to the word, but, according to his invariable practice in
such a case, he places it behind the transparent veil of an eloquent
tirade.</p>

<p>“This is the reason,” says he, “which in all ages has forced the
Fathers of nations to have recourse to the intervention of heaven,
and to give the credit of their own wisdom to the gods, in order
that the people, submitting to the laws of the state as to those <em class="e000I2">of
nature</em>, and acknowledging the same power in the formation of man
and of the commonwealth, should obey <em class="e000I2">freely</em> and bear willingly
the yoke of the public felicity. This <em class="e000I2">sublime</em> reason, which is
above the reach of vulgar souls, is that <em class="e000I2">whose decisions the legislator
puts into the mouth of the immortals</em>, in order to <em class="e000I2">carry along</em> by
divine authority those who cannot be moved by considerations of
human prudence. But it is not for every man to make <em class="e000I2">the gods</em>
speak,” etc.</p>

<p>And in order that there may be no mistake, he cites Machiavel,
and allows him to complete the idea: “Mai non fu alcuno ordinatore
de leggi <em class="e0U003">STRAORDINARIE</em> in un popolo che non ricorresse a
Dio.”</p>

<p>But why does Machiavel counsel us to have recourse to <em class="e000I2">God</em>,
and Rousseau to <em class="e000I2">the gods</em>, to the <em class="e000I2">immortals</em>? The reader can
answer that question for himself.</p>

<p>I do not indeed accuse the modern <em class="e000I2">Fathers of nations</em> of making
use of these unworthy deceptions. But when we place ourselves
in their point of view, we see that they readily allow themselves
to be hurried along by the desire of success. When an earnest
and philanthropical man is deeply convinced that he possesses a
social secret by means of which all his fellow-men may enjoy in
this world unlimited happiness,—when he sees clearly that he
can practically establish that idea neither by force nor by reasoning,
and that deception is his only resource, he is laid under a
very strong temptation. We know that the ministers of religion
themselves, who profess the greatest horror of untruth, have not
rejected <em class="e000I2">pious frauds</em>; and we see by the example of Rousseau
<a id="p057" class="xxpn">[p057]</a> (that austere writer, who has inscribed at the head of all his works
the motto, <em class="e000I2">Vitam impendere vero</em>), that even a proud philosophy
can allow itself to be seduced by the attraction of a very different
maxim, namely, <em class="e000I2">The end justifies the means</em>. Why then should
we be surprised that modern <em class="e000I2">organisateurs</em> should think also “<em class="e000I2">to
place their own wisdom to the credit of the gods, to put their decisions
in the mouths of the immortals, hurrying us along without violence
and persuading without convincing us</em>!”</p>

<p>We know that, after the example of Moses, Fourier has preceded
his Deuteronomy by a Genesis. Saint Simon and his disciples
had gone still farther in their apostolic senilities. Others,
more discreet, attached themselves to a latitudinarian faith, modified
to suit their views, under the name of <em class="e000I2">néochristianisme</em>; and
every one must be struck with the tone of mystic affectation
which nearly all our modern reformers have introduced into their
sermons.</p>

<p>Efforts of this kind have served only to prove one thing, and it
is not unimportant—namely, that in our days the man is not
always a prophet who wishes to be one. In vain he proclaims
himself a god; he is believed by no one; neither by the public,
nor by his compeers, nor by himself.</p>

<p>Since I have spoken of Rousseau, I may be permitted to make
here some observations on that manufacturer of systems, inasmuch
as they will serve to point out the distinctions between artificial
and natural organization. This digression, besides, is not out of
place, as the <em class="e000I2">Contrat Social</em> has again for some time been held forth
as the oracle of the future.</p>

<p>Rousseau was convinced that <em class="e000I2">isolation</em> was man’s <em class="e000I2">natural state</em>,
and, consequently, that <em class="e000I2">society</em> was a human invention. “<em class="e000I2">The
social order</em>,” he says in the outset, “<em class="e000I2">comes not from nature</em>, and
is therefore founded on convention.”</p>

<p>This philosopher, although a passionate lover of liberty, had a
very low opinion of men. He believed them to be quite incapable
of forming for themselves good institutions. The intervention of
a founder, a legislator, a father of nations, was therefore indispensable.</p>

<p>“A people subjected to laws,” says he, “should be the authors
of them. It belongs alone to those who associate to adjust the
conditions of their association; but how are they to regulate them?
By common consent, or by sudden inspiration? How should a
blind multitude, who frequently know not what they want, because
they rarely know what is good for them, accomplish of themselves
an enterprise so great and so difficult as the formation of a system
<a id="p058" class="xxpn">[p058]</a> of laws?&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. Individuals perceive what is good, and reject it—the
public wishes for what is good, but cannot discover it:—all are
equally in want of guides.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. Hence the necessity of a legislator.”</p>

<p>That legislator, as we have already seen, “not being able to
employ force or reason, is under the necessity of having recourse
to an authority of another kind;” that is to say, in plain terms,
to deception.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give an idea of the immense height at which
Rousseau places his legislator above other men:</p>

<p>“Gods would be necessary in order to give laws to men.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.
He who dares to found a nation must feel himself in a condition
to change human nature, so to speak,&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. to alter the constitution
of man in order to strengthen it.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. He must take from man his
own force, in order to give him that which is foreign to him.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.
The lawgiver is in all respects an extraordinary man in the state,&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.
his employment is a peculiar and superior function which has
nothing in common with ordinary government.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. If it be true that
a great prince is a rare character, what must a great lawgiver be?
The first has only to follow the model which the other is to
propose to him. The one is the mechanician who invents the
machine—the other merely puts it together and sets it in motion.”</p>

<p>And what is the part assigned to human nature in all this? It
is but the base material of which the machine is composed.</p>

<p>In sober reality, is this anything else than pride elevated to
madness? Men are the materials of a machine, which the prince,
the ruling power, sets in motion. The lawgiver proposes the
model. The philosopher governs the lawgiver, placing himself
thus at an immeasurable distance above the vulgar herd, above the
ruler, above the lawgiver himself. He soars far above the human
race, actuates it, transforms it, moulds it, or rather he teaches the
Fathers of nations how they are to do all this.</p>

<p>But the founder of a nation must propose to himself a design.
He has his human material to set in motion, and he must direct
its movements to a definite result. As the people are deprived of
the initiative, and all depends upon the legislator, he must decide
whether the nation is to be commercial or agricultural, or a barbarous
race of hunters and fishers; but it is desirable at the same
time that the legislator should not himself be mistaken, and so do
too much violence to the nature of things.</p>

<p>Men in <em class="e000I2">agreeing</em> to enter into an association, or rather in associating
under the fiat of a lawgiver, have a precise and definite
design. “Thus,” says Rousseau, “the Hebrews, and, more recently,
the Arabs, had for their principal object religion; the <a id="p059" class="xxpn">[p059]</a>
Athenians, letters; Carthage and Tyre, commerce; Rhodes, navigation;
Sparta, war; and Rome, virtue.”</p>

<p>What object is to determine us Frenchmen to leave the state of
isolation and of nature, in order to form a society? Or rather—as
we are only so much inert matter—the materials of a machine,—towards
what object shall our great founder direct us?</p>

<p>Following the ideas of Rousseau, there could be but little room
for learning, commerce, or navigation. War is a nobler object, and
virtue still more so. But there is another, the noblest of all:
“The end of every system of legislation is <em class="e000I2">liberty and equality</em>.”</p>

<p>But we must first of all discover what Rousseau understands by
liberty. To enjoy liberty, according to him, is not to be free, but
to <em class="e000I2">exercise the suffrage</em>, when we are “borne along without violence,
and persuaded without being convinced;” for then “we obey
with freedom, and bear willingly the yoke of the public felicity.”</p>

<p>“Among the Greeks,” he says, “all that the people had to do
they did for themselves, they were constantly assembled in the
market-place; they inhabited a genial climate; they were not
avaricious; <em class="e000I2">slaves did all their work; their grand concern was their
liberty</em>.”</p>

<p>“The English people,” he remarks in another place, “believe
themselves free,—they are much mistaken. They are so only
during the election of their members of parliament; the moment
the election is over, they are slaves—they are nothing.”</p>

<p>The people, if they will be free, must, then, themselves perform
all duties in connexion with the public service, for it is in that
that liberty consists. They must be always voting and electing,
always in the market-place. Woe to him who takes it into his
head to work for his living! the moment a citizen begins to mind
his own affairs, that instant (to use Rousseau’s favourite phrase)
<em class="e000I2">tout est perdu</em>—all is over with him.</p>

<p>And yet the difficulty is by no means trifling. How are we
to manage? for, after all, before we can either practise virtue, or
exercise liberty, we must have the means of living.</p>

<p>We have already remarked the rhetorical veil under which
Rousseau conceals the word <em class="e000I2">Imposture</em>. We shall now see how,
by another dash of eloquence, he evades the conclusion of his
whole work, which is <em class="e000I2">Slavery</em>.</p>

<p>“Your ungenial climate entails upon you additional wants. For
six months of the year you cannot frequent the market-place, your
hoarse voices cannot make themselves audible in the open air,
and you fear poverty more than slavery.”</p>

<p>“You see clearly that you cannot be free.” <a id="p060" class="xxpn">[p060]</a></p>

<p>“What! liberty maintain itself only by the aid of servitude?
Very likely!”</p>

<p>Had Rousseau stopt short at this dreadful word, the reader
would have been shocked. It was necessary therefore to have recourse
to imposing declamation, and Rousseau never fails in that.</p>

<p>“All things that are unnatural (it is society he is speaking of)
are inconvenient, and civil society more so than all the rest.
There are unfortunate situations in which one man cannot maintain
his liberty but at the expense of another, and where the citizen
cannot be entirely free unless the rigours of slavery are extreme.
As for you, modern people, you have no slavery, but you are
yourselves slaves. You purchase other men’s liberty with your
own. In vain you boast of this advantage. I see in it rather
cowardice than humanity.”</p>

<p>I ask, does not this mean: Modern people, you would do infinitely
better not to be slaves, but to possess slaves?</p>

<p>I trust the reader will have the goodness to pardon this long
digression, which is by no means useless or inopportune. Rousseau
and his disciples of the Convention have been held up to us
of late as the apostles of human fraternity. Men for materials, a
ruler for mechanician, a father of nations for inventor, a philosopher
above them all—imposture for means, slavery for result,—is this
the fraternity which is promised us?</p>

<p>This work of Rousseau to which I have referred—the <em class="e000I2">Contrat
Social</em>—appears to me well fitted to exhibit the characteristics of
these artificial social organizations. The inventors of such systems
set out with the idea that society is a state contrary to nature,
and they seek to subject humanity to different combinations. They
forget that its motive power, its spring of action, is in itself. They
regard men as base materials, and aspire to impart to them movement
and will, sentiment and life; placing themselves at an immeasurable
height above the whole human race. These are
features common to all the inventors of social organizations.
The inventions are different—the inventors are alike.</p>

<p>Among the new arrangements which feeble mortals are invited
to make trial of, there is one which is presented to us in terms
worthy of attention. Its formula is: <em class="e000I2">Association voluntary and
progressive</em>.</p>

<p>But <em class="e000I2">Political Economy</em> is founded exactly on the datum, that
<em class="e000I2">society</em> is nothing else than <em class="e000I2">association</em> (such as the above three
words describe it)—association, very imperfect at first, because
man is imperfect; but improving as man improves, that is to say,
<em class="e000I2">progressive</em>. <a id="p061" class="xxpn">[p061]</a></p>

<p>Is your object to effect a more intimate association between
labour, capital, and talent, insuring thereby to the members of the
human family a greater amount of material enjoyment—enjoyment
more equally distributed? If such associations are <em class="e000I2">voluntary</em>; if
force and constraint do not intervene; if the cost is defrayed by
those who enter these associations, without drawing upon those who
refuse to enter them, in what respect are they repugnant to Political
Economy? Is it not the business of Political Economy, as a
science, to examine the various forms in which men may unite
their powers, and divide their employments, with a view to greater
and more widely diffused prosperity? Does trade not frequently
afford us examples of two, three, or four persons uniting to form
such associations? Is <em class="e000I2">Métayage</em><a
href="#FN_17" id="FNa_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> not a sort of informal association
of capital and labour? Have we not in recent times seen joint
stock companies formed which afford to the smallest capitals the
opportunity of taking part in the most extensive enterprizes?
Have we not certain manufactures in which it is sought to give
the labourers an interest in the profits? Does Political Economy
condemn those efforts of men to make their industry more productive
and profitable? Does she affirm anywhere that human
nature has reached perfection? Quite the contrary. I believe that
there is no science which demonstrates more clearly that society
is still in its infancy.</p>

<p>But whatever hopes we may entertain as to the future, whatever
ideas we may conceive as to the measures that men may adopt for
the improvement of their mutual relations, and the diffusion of
happiness, knowledge, and morality, we must never forget that
society is an organization which has for its element a moral and
intelligent agent, endued with free will, and susceptible of improvement.
If you take away Liberty from man, he becomes
nothing else than a rude and wretched machine.</p>

<p>Liberty would seem not to be wanted in our days. In France, the
privileged land of fashion, freedom appears to be no longer in repute.
For myself, I say that he who rejects liberty has no faith in human
nature. Of late the distressing discovery seems to have been
made that liberty leads inevitably to monopoly.<a
href="#FN_18" id="FNa_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> This monstrous
union, this unnatural conjunction, does not exist; it is the imaginary
fruit of an error which the light of Political Economy speedily <a id="p062" class="xxpn">[p062]</a> dissipates.
Freedom engender monopoly! Oppression the offspring of
liberty! To affirm this is to affirm that the tendencies of human
nature are radically bad—bad in themselves, in their nature, in their
essence. It is to affirm that the natural bent of man is to deterioration;
that the human mind is irresistibly attracted towards error.
To what end, then, our schools, our studies, our inquiries, our discussions,
unless to accelerate our progress towards that fatal descent;
since to teach men to judge, to distinguish, to select, is only to teach
them to commit suicide? And if the tendencies of human nature
are essentially perverse, where are the organizers of new social
systems to place the fulcrum of that lever by which they hope to
effect their changes? It must be somewhere beyond the limits of
the present domain of humanity. Do they search for it in themselves—in
their own minds and hearts? They are not gods yet;
they are men, and tending, consequently, along with the whole
human race, towards the fatal abyss. Shall they invoke the intervention
of the state? The state also is composed of men. They
must therefore prove that they form a distinct class, for whom the
general laws of society are not intended, since it is their province
to make these laws. Unless this be proved the difficulty is not
removed, it is not even diminished.</p>

<p>Let us not thus condemn human nature before studying its laws,
its forces, its energies, its tendencies. Newton, after he discovered
attraction, never pronounced the name of God without uncovering
his head. Yet the celestial mechanism is subject to laws of which
it has no consciousness; and the social world is as much superior
to that which called forth the admiration of Newton as mind is
superior to matter. How much more reason, then, have we to
bow before Omniscience when we behold the social mechanism,
which universal intelligence no less pervades (<em class="e000I2">mens agitat molem</em>);
and which presents, moreover, this extraordinary phenomenon,
that every atom of which it is composed is an animated thinking
being, endued with marvellous energy, and with that principle of
all morality, all dignity, all progress, the exclusive attribute of
man—<em class="e00S02">Liberty</em>. <a id="p063" class="xxpn">[p063]</a></p>

<p class="chapterhead">
What a profoundly afflicting spectacle France presents to us!</p>

<p>It would be difficult to say if anarchy has passed from ideas to
facts, or from facts to ideas, but it is certain that it pervades all,
and abounds everywhere.</p>

<p>The poor rise up against the rich, men without fortune or profession
against property; the populace against the bourgeoisie;
labour against capital; agriculture against manufactures; the
country against the town; the provinces against the metropolis;
the denizen against the stranger.</p>

<p>And theorists step in, and form a system of this antagonism.
“It is the <em class="e000I2">inevitable</em> result, they say, of the nature of things, that is
to say, of Liberty. Man is endued with <em class="e000I2">self-love</em>, and hence comes
all the evil; for since he is endued with self-love, he seeks to better
his own condition, and he can only do so by entailing misery
on his brethren. Let us hinder him, then, from following his inclinations;
let us stifle his liberty, change the human heart, substitute
other motives for those which God has placed there: let
us invent and constitute an artificial society!”</p>

<p>When they have got this length, an unlimited career opens
itself to their reason or imagination. If they are possessed of a disputatious
turn and a peevish temper, they enter with eagerness into
an analysis of Evil. They dissect it, they put it in the crucible,
they interrogate it, they remount to its causes, they pursue it to its
consequences; and, as by reason of our native imperfection there
is nothing in which Evil is not present, they asperse and disparage
everything. They exhibit to us Property, Family, Capital, Labour,
Competition, Liberty, Personal Interest, only in one of their
aspects, and always on the dark side, the side which injures or
<a id="p064" class="xxpn">[p064]</a> destroys. Their lectures on the natural history of man are, if I
may use the expression, clinical lectures—the subject is always on
his deathbed. They impiously defy God to reconcile what is said
of His infinite goodness with the existence of evil. They stain
and sully everything; they disgust us with everything; they dispute
everything; and yet they obtain only a melancholy and
dangerous success with those classes whom suffering disposes but
too much to despair.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, such theorists have a heart open to benevolence,
a mind which is pleased with illusions, they rush to the
region of chimeras. They dream of an Oceania, an Atlantis, a
Salente, a Spensonie, an Icarie, a Utopia, a Phalanstère,<a
href="#FN_20" id="FNa_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> and
they people these imaginary regions with a docile, loving, devoted
race who always avoid setting themselves up against the fancies
of the dreamer. He installs himself complacently in the seat of
Providence. He arranges, he disposes, he moulds men after his
own fancy. Nothing stops him. He never encounters deceit.
He resembles the Roman preacher, who, after having transformed
his square cap into Rousseau, refuted warmly the <em class="e000I2">Contrat Social</em>,
and triumphantly reduced his adversary to silence. It is thus that
our Reformers dazzle those who suffer by means of seductive
pictures of ideal felicity, well fitted to disgust them with the hard
necessities of real life.</p>

<p>The theorist, however, rarely confines himself to such innocent
chimeras. The moment he aims at leading mankind, he finds the
people impatient of attempted transformations. Men resist, they
get angry. In order to gain them over, he harangues them not
only on the happiness they reject, but more especially on the evils
from which he professes to deliver them. He finds it impossible
to make too striking a picture. He is continually charging his
palette and deepening his colours. He hunts out the evils of existing
society with as much zeal as another employs in discovering
the good. He sees nothing but sufferings, rags, leanness, starvation,
pain, oppression. He is enraged that society has not a deeper
sense of its misery. He neglects no means of making it throw off
its insensibility, and, having begun with benevolence, he ends with
misanthropy.<a
href="#FN_21" id="FNa_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>God forbid that I should call in question the sincerity of any
one. But, in truth, I cannot explain to myself how these writers,
<a id="p065" class="xxpn">[p065]</a> who see a radical antagonism in the natural order of things, can
ever taste a moment’s calm or repose. Discouragement and
despair would seem to be their unhappy portion. For, to sum up
all, if nature is mistaken in making <em class="e000I2">personal interest</em> the mainspring
of human society (and the mistake is manifest if it be
admitted that the interests of society are fatally antagonistic), how
do they not perceive that the evil is without remedy? Being men
ourselves, and being able to have recourse only to men, where can
be our <em class="e000I2">point d’appui</em> for changing the tendencies of human nature?
Shall we invoke the Police, the Magistracy, the State, the Legislature?
That would only be to invoke men, that is to say, beings
subject to the common infirmity. Shall we address ourselves to
Universal Suffrage? That would be to give the freest course to
the universal tendency.</p>

<p>Only one expedient remains to these gentlemen. It is to hold
themselves out as discoverers, as prophets, made of different clay
from their fellow-men, and deriving their inspiration from a different
source. This is the reason, no doubt, why we find them so frequently
enveloping their systems and their councils in a mystic
phraseology. But if they are ambassadors of God, let them exhibit
their credentials. In effect, what they demand is sovereign power,
despotism the most absolute that ever existed. They not only wish
to govern our acts, but to revolutionize our thoughts. Do they
hope that mankind will believe them on their word, when they
are not able to agree among themselves?</p>

<p>But before even examining their projects of artificial societies,
is there not one point upon which it is necessary to assure ourselves,
namely, whether they are not mistaken in the very foundation
of their argument? Is it quite certain that <em class="e0U003">MEN’S INTERESTS
ARE NATURALLY ANTAGONISTIC</em>; that an irremediable cause of
inequality is fatally developed in the natural order of human society
under the influence of personal interest, and that Providence
is manifestly in error in ordaining that the progress of man should
be towards ease and competency?</p>

<p>This is what I propose to inquire into.</p>

<p>Taking man as it has pleased God to constitute him, capable of
foresight and experience, perfectible, endued with self-love, it is
true,—but self-love qualified by the sympathetic principle, and at
all events restrained and balanced by encountering an analogous
sentiment universally prevailing in the medium in which it acts,—I
proceed to inquire what social order must necessarily result from
the combination and free play of such elements.</p>

<p>If we find that this result is nothing else than a progressive
<a id="p066" class="xxpn">[p066]</a> march towards prosperity, improvement, and equality,—a sustained
approximation of all classes towards the same physical, intellectual,
and moral level, accompanied by a constant elevation of that level,
the ways of God to man will be vindicated. We shall learn with
delight that there is no gap, no blank, in creation, and that the
social order, like everything else, attests the existence of those
<em class="e000I2">harmonic laws</em> before which Newton bowed his head, and which
elicited from the Psalmist the exclamation, “<em class="e000I2">The heavens declare the
glory of God.</em>”</p>

<p>Rousseau has said, “If I were a prince or a legislator, I should
not lose my time in pointing out what was necessary to be done—I
should do it or hold my tongue.”</p>

<p>I am not a <em class="e000I2">prince</em>, but the confidence of my fellow-citizens has
made me a <em class="e000I2">legislator</em>. Perhaps they will tell me that this is the
time for me to act and not to write.</p>

<p>Let them pardon me. Whether it be truth itself which urges
me on, or that I am the dupe of an illusion. I have never ceased
to feel the want of concentrating those ideas which have hitherto
failed to find acceptance when presented in detached portions. I
think I discover in the play of the natural laws of society sublime
and consoling <em class="e000I2">harmonies</em>. What I see, or think I see, ought I not
to try to exhibit to others, in order to rally round a sentiment
of concord and fraternity many unsettled minds, many imbittered
hearts? If, when the much-loved vessel of the state is beat by
the tempest, I sometimes appear to absent myself from my post,
in order to collect my scattered thoughts, it is because I feel my
feeble hands unfitted for the work. Is it, besides, to betray my
mission, to reflect upon the causes of the tempest itself, and endeavour
to act upon these causes? And then, what I find I cannot
do to-day, who knows but it may be given me to accomplish
to-morrow?</p>

<p>I shall begin by establishing some Economical ideas. Availing
myself of the works of my predecessors, I shall endeavour to sum
up the science in one principle—true, simple, and prolific—of which
we have had a glimpse from the beginning, to which we are
constantly drawing nearer and nearer, and of which, perhaps, the
time is now come to fix the formula. By the light thus afforded,
I shall afterwards essay the solution of some yet disputed problems—Competition,
Machinery, Foreign trade, Luxury, Capital, Rent,
etc. I shall note some of the relations, or, I should rather say,
the harmonies of Political Economy, with the other moral and
social sciences, glancing at the important subjects indicated by
the terms—Personal Interest, Property, Community, Liberty,
<a id="p067" class="xxpn">[p067]</a> Equality, Responsibility, Solidarity, Fraternity, Unity. Last of
all, I shall invite attention to the artificial obstacles which the
pacific, regular, and progressive development of human society
encounters. From these two ideas—Natural harmonic Laws—Artificial
disturbing Causes—will be deduced the solution of the
Social Problem.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that there are two rocks ahead upon which
this undertaking may founder. In the middle of the vortex in
which we are carried along, if this work is abstruse, it will not be
read; if it obtains readers, the questions of which it treats will be
but glanced at. How are we to reconcile the exactions of the
reader with the requirements of science? To satisfy all conditions
both in form and substance, each word would require to be weighed,
and have its proper place assigned to it. It is thus that the crystal
is formed drop by drop in silence and obscurity. Retirement,
quiet, time, freedom from care—all are wanting to me—and I am
forced to trust to the sagacity of the public, and throw myself on
its indulgence.</p>

<p>The subject of Political Economy is Man.</p>

<p>But it does not embrace the whole range of human affairs. The
science of morals has appropriated all that comes within the attractive
regions of Sympathy—the religious sentiment, paternal
and maternal tenderness, filial piety, love, friendship, patriotism,
charity, politeness. To Political Economy is left only the cold
domain of Personal interest. This is unjustly forgotten when
Economical science is reproached with wanting the charm and
unction of morals. How can it be otherwise? Dispute its right
to existence as a science, but don’t force it to counterfeit what it is
not, and cannot be. If human transactions which have wealth
for their object are vast enough, complicated enough, to afford
materials for a special science, leave to it its own attractions, such
as they are, and don’t force it to speak of men’s Interests in the
language of Sentiment. For my own part, I believe that little
good has been effected of late in exacting from writers on Political
Economy a tone of enthusiastic sentimentality which in their
mouth can only be declamation. Of what do they treat? Of
transactions which take place between people who know nothing
of each other, who owe each other nothing but common Justice,
who seek to defend or advance certain interests. It has to do
with claims and pretensions which limit and restrain each other,
and with which disinterestedness and devotion have nothing to do.
Take a lyre, and chant such themes! As well might Lamartine
sing his odes with the aid of the logarithm tables. <a id="p068" class="xxpn">[p068]</a></p>

<p>Not that Political Economy is without its poetry. There is
poetry wherever order and harmony exist. But it is in the results,
not in the demonstrations. It is brought out, not created. Kepler
did not give himself out as a poet, and yet the laws which he discovered
are the true poetry of mind.</p>

<p>Thus, Political Economy regards man only in one aspect, and
our first care must be to study man in that point of view. This is
the reason why we cannot avoid going back to the primary phenomena
of human <em class="e000I2">Sensibility</em> and <em class="e000I2">Activity</em>. Start not, gentle reader!
We shall not detain you long in those cloudy regions of metaphysics,
and we shall borrow from that science only such notions as
are clear, simple, and, if possible, incontestable.</p>

<p>The soul, or (to get rid of the spiritual question) man, is endued
with <em class="e000I2">Sensibility</em>. Let this sensibility be either in the soul or in
the body, man, as a <em class="e000I2">passive</em> being, always experiences <em class="e000I2">sensations</em>
either painful or agreeable. As an <em class="e000I2">active</em> being, he makes an
effort to drive away the one set of sensations and to multiply the
other. The result, which affects him again as a <em class="e000I2">passive</em> being,
may be called <em class="e000I2">Satisfaction</em>.</p>

<p>The general idea of <em class="e000I2">Sensibility</em> springs from other ideas which
are more precise: pain, want, desire, taste, appetite, on one side;
and, on the other, pleasure, enjoyment, competence.</p>

<p>Between these two extremes a middle term is interposed, and
from the general idea of <em class="e000I2">Activity</em> spring the more precise ideas of
pain, effort, fatigue, labour, production.</p>

<p>In analyzing <em class="e000I2">Sensibility</em> and <em
class="e000I2">Activity</em> we encounter a word common to both; the
word <em class="e000I2">Pain</em>. To experience certain sensations
is a <em class="e000I2">pain</em>, and we cannot put an end to it
but by an effort, which is also a <em class="e000I2">pain</em>.
We <em class="e000I2">feel pains</em>; we <em class="e000I2">take
pains</em>. This advertises us that here below we have only a choice
of evils.</p>

<p>In the aggregate of these phenomena all is <em
class="e000I2">personal</em>, as well the Sensation which precedes
the effort, as the Satisfaction which follows it.</p>

<p>We cannot doubt, then, that <em class="e000I2">Personal
interest</em> is the great mainspring of human nature. It must be
perfectly understood, however, that this term is here employed as
the expression of a universal fact, incontestable, and resulting
from the organization of man,—and not of a critical judgment on his
conduct and actions, as if, instead of it, we should employ the word
<em class="e000I2">egotism</em>. Moral science would be rendered
impossible, if we were to pervert beforehand the terms of which it is
compelled to make use.</p>

<p>Human effort does not always come necessarily to place
itself between the sensation and the satisfaction. Sometimes
the <a id="p069" class="xxpn">[p069]</a> satisfaction comes of
its own accord. More frequently the effort is exercised upon
<em class="e000I2">materials</em>, by the intervention of <em
class="e000I2">forces</em> which nature has placed gratuitously at
our disposal.</p>

<p>If we give the name of <em class="e000I2">Utility</em> to all which effects the satisfaction
of wants, there are, then, utilities of two kinds:—one, vouchsafed
to us gratuitously by Providence; the other (if I may use the expression),
requiring to be purchased by an <em class="e000I2">Effort</em>.</p>

<p>Thus the complete evolution embraces, or may embrace, these
four ideas:</p>

<div class="tablebox"><div class="tableinline">
<table id="persint" summary="the evolution of Personal Interest">
<tr><td>Wants</td>
 <td id="utility">Gratuitous Utility<br />Onerous Utility</td>
 <td>Satisfaction.</td></tr>
</table></div></div>

<p>Man is endued with progressive faculties. He compares,
he foresees, he learns, he reforms himself, by experience.
If want is a <em class="e000I2">pain</em>, effort is a <em
class="e000I2">pain</em> also, and there is therefore no reason
why he should not seek to diminish the latter, when he can do
so without diminishing the satisfaction, which is his ultimate
object. This is the reason of his success when he comes to replace
<em class="e000I2">onerous</em> by <em class="e000I2">gratuitous
Utility</em>, which is the perpetual object of his search.</p>

<p>It follows from the <em class="e000I2">interested</em> nature of
the human heart, that we constantly seek to increase the proportion
which our Satisfactions bear to our Efforts; and it results from the
intelligent nature of our mind that we manage at each step to augment
the proportion which gratuitous bears to onerous Utility.</p>

<p>Every time a success of this nature is achieved, a part of our
efforts is, so to speak, rendered disposable, and we have the option
of either indulging ourselves with longer repose, or of working
for the satisfaction of new desires, if these are strong enough to
stimulate our activity.</p>

<p>Such is the principle of all economic progress; and it is easy to
see that it is the principle also of all deception; for progress and
error have both their root in that marvellous gift of God to man—<em
class="e000I2">Free will</em>.</p>

<p>We are endued with the faculty of comparing, of judging, of
choosing, and of acting in consequence; which implies that we may
form a right or a wrong judgment, and make a good or a bad choice. It
is never useless to remind men of this when they talk of Liberty.</p>

<p>We never deceive ourselves, it is true, regarding the particular
nature of our sensations, and we discern with an infallible instinct
whether they are painful or agreeable. But how many various forms
may our errors take! We may be labouring under a mistake as to the
cause, and pursue with ardour, as likely to afford us enjoyment,
what can only indict pain upon us; or we may be <a id="p070"
class="xxpn">[p070]</a> mistaken as to the chain of consequences,
and be ignorant that an immediate satisfaction will be followed
by greater ulterior pain; or, again, we may mistake the relative
importance of our wants and our desires.</p>

<p>Not only may we thus give a false direction to our efforts through
ignorance, but also through a perverse will. “Man,” says M. Bonald,
“is an intelligence served by organs.” What! is there nothing else in
us? Have we no passions?</p>

<p>When we speak of harmony, then, we must not be understood to mean
that the natural arrangement of the social world is such that error
and vice have been excluded from it. To maintain that thesis in the
face of plain facts would be to carry the love of system to madness.
To have harmony without dissonance man must either be devoid of free
will or he must be infallible. All we say is this, that the great
social tendencies are harmonious, inasmuch as—all error leading
to deception and all vice to chastisement—the dissonances have a
continual tendency to disappear.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>A first and vague notion of property may be deduced from
these premises. Since it is the individual who experiences the
sensation, the desire, the want,—since it is he who makes the <em
class="e000I2">Effort</em>,—the satisfaction must necessarily redound
to him, for otherwise the effort would be without cause or reason.</p>

<p>The same may be said of <em class="e000I2">Inheritance</em>.
No theory, no declamation, is required in order to make fathers
love their children. People who sit down to manufacture
imaginary societies may think it strange, but it is so;—a
father makes as many <em class="e000I2">Efforts</em> for the
<em class="e000I2">satisfaction</em> of his children as for his
own. Perhaps he makes more. If, then, an unnatural law should
interdict the transmission of property, not only would that
law violate property by the very act, but it would hinder its
formation by abandoning to inaction one-half at least of our <em
class="e000I2">Efforts</em>.</p>

<p>We shall have occasion to return to the subjects of Personal
interest, Property, and Inheritance. Let us, in the first instance,
mark out the limits of the science with which we have more
immediately to do.</p>

<p>I am not one of those who think that a science, as such, has
natural and unalterable boundaries. In the domain of ideas, as in
that of facts, all things are bound up and linked together; truths
run into one another; and there is no science which, in order to be
complete, might not be made to include all. It has been said with
reason that to an infinite intelligence there is but a single verity.
It is, then, our weakness which obliges us to study separately a <a
id="p071" class="xxpn">[p071]</a> certain order of phenomena, and the
classifications which result from it cannot escape a certain decree
of arbitrariness.</p>

<p>The true merit is to explain accurately the facts, their causes,
and their consequences. It is also a merit, although a much less
and a purely relative one, to determine, not rigorously—for that is
impossible—but rationally, the order of the facts which we propose to
study.</p>

<p>I say this in order that it may not be supposed that I intend
to criticise my predecessors if I give to Political Economy limits
somewhat different from those which they have assigned to that
science.</p>

<p>Economists have of late been reproached with addicting themselves
too much to the study of <em class="e000I2">Wealth</em>. It has been
wished that they had found a place in their science for all that,
directly or indirectly, contributes to the happiness or sufferings
of humanity. They have even been supposed to deny everything
which they did not profess to teach—for example, the phenomena of
sympathy, which is as natural to the heart of man as the principle of
self-interest. It is as if they accused the mineralogist of denying
the existence of the animal kingdom. What! Wealth, the laws of its
production, of its distribution, of its consumption,—is not this a
subject vast enough, and important enough, to be made the object of a
special science? If the conclusions of the Economist were at variance
with those of morals and politics. I could conceive ground for the
accusation. One might say to him, “In limiting your science you are
mistaken, for it is not possible for two verities to run counter to
each other.” Perhaps one result of the work which I now submit to
the public may be, that the Science of Wealth will be found to be in
perfect harmony with all the other sciences.</p>

<p>Of the three terms comprehended in the human destinies—Sensation,
Effort, Satisfaction—the first and the last are always and
necessarily confounded in the same individuality. It is impossible
to imagine them separated. We can conceive a sensation unsatisfied,
a want unappeased, but it is quite impossible to suppose the
<em class="e000I2">want</em> to be in one man and the <em
class="e000I2">satisfaction</em> to be in another.</p>

<p>If the same observation applied to the middle term, <em
class="e000I2">Effort</em>, man would be a being completely solitary.
The Economic phenomena would then manifest themselves in an isolated
individual. There might be a juxtaposition of persons, but there
could be no society; there might be a Personal, but not a Political,
Economy.</p>

<p>But it is not so. It is very possible, and very often
happens, that the <em class="e000I2">wants</em> of one
owe their <em class="e000I2">satisfaction</em> to the <em
class="e000I2">efforts</em> of <a id="p072" class="xxpn">[p072]</a>
another. This is a fact. If any one of us were to pass in review all
the satisfactions he enjoys, he would acknowledge that he owes them
chiefly to efforts which he has not himself made; and in the same
way, the labour which we undergo, each in his own profession, goes
almost always to satisfy the desires of others.</p>

<p>This tells us, that it is neither in the wants nor in
the satisfactions (phenomena essentially personal and
intransmissible), but in the nature of the mean term, <em
class="e000I2">human Efforts</em>, that we must search for the
<em class="e000I2">social</em> principle—the origin of Political
Economy.</p>

<p>It is in fact to this faculty, given to men, and to men alone,
among all creatures, to <em class="e000I2">work the one for the
other</em>; it is this transmission of efforts, this exchange
of services, with all the infinite and involved combinations to
which it gives rise, through time and through space, it is <em
class="e0U003">THIS</em> precisely which constitutes Economic
Science, points out its origin, and determines its limits.</p>

<p>I say, then:</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Every effort, capable of satisfying, on
condition of a return, the wants of a person other than the man
who makes the effort, and consequently the wants and satisfactions
relative to this species of effort, constitute the domain of
Political Economy.</em></p>

<p>Thus, to give an example: the act of breathing, although it
includes the three terms which constitute the Economic phenomenon,
does not pertain to that science, and we see the reason. What we
have here to do with is a series of facts, of which not only the two
extremes—want and satisfaction—are incapable of transmission (they
are always so); but the mean term, <em class="e000I2">Effort</em>,
is also incapable of transmission. To enable us to respire we
invoke the assistance of no one; in that there is neither a service
to be received nor a service to render. The fact is in its nature
individual, not <em class="e000I2">social</em>, and consequently
cannot enter into a science which is essentially one of relation, as
its very name indicates.</p>

<p>But if, in peculiar circumstances, people were to render each
other assistance to enable them to breathe, as when a workman
descends in a diving-bell, when a physician treats a patient
for pulmonary complaints, or when the police take measures for
purifying the air, in such cases there is a want satisfied by a
person other than the person who experiences the want; there is
a service rendered; and respiration itself, as far at least as
concerns assistance and remuneration, is brought within the sphere of
Political Economy.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that the transaction should be
completed, it is sufficient that it is possible, in order to
impart to the <em class="e000I2">labour</em> employed an <em
class="e000I2">economic</em> character. The labourer who raises corn
<a id="p073" class="xxpn">[p073]</a> for his own use accomplishes
an economic fact in this respect that the corn is capable of being
exchanged.</p>

<p>To make an effort in order to satisfy another’s wants is to render
him a <em class="e000I2">service</em>. If a service is stipulated in
return, there is an exchange of <em class="e000I2">services</em>; and
as this is the most ordinary case, Political Economy may be defined
<em class="e000I2">the theory of Exchange</em>.</p>

<p>Whatever may be for one of the contracting parties the
urgency of the want, or for the other the intensity of the
effort, if the exchange is free, the two services exchanged
are <em class="e000I2">worth each other</em>. Value, then,
consists in the comparative appreciation of reciprocal <em
class="e000I2">services</em>, and Political Economy again may be
defined <em class="e000I2">the theory of Value</em>.</p>

<p>I have just defined Political Economy, and marked out
its domain, without mentioning an essential element, <em
class="e000I2">gratuitous Utility</em>.</p>

<p>All authors have remarked that we derive a multitude of
satisfactions from this source. They denominate these utilities, such
as air, water, the light of the sun, etc., <em class="e000I2">natural
wealth</em>, in contradistinction to <em class="e000I2">social
wealth</em>, and having done so, they take no more notice of them;
and in fact it would seem that, as they give rise to no effort, to no
exchange, to no service, as (being destitute of value) they figure in
no inventory of goods, they should not be admitted into the domain of
Political Economy.</p>

<p>This exclusion would be rational if <em
class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> utility were a fixed invariable
quantity, always separated from <em class="e000I2">onerous</em>
utility; but they are constantly mixed up, and in inverse
proportions. Man’s constant endeavour is to substitute the one
for the other, that is to say, to arrive, by means of natural and
gratuitous agents, at the same results as by efforts. He accomplishes
by the wind, by gravitation, by heat, by the elasticity of the air,
what he accomplished at first only by muscular exertion.</p>

<p>Now what happens? Although the effect is equally useful, the
effort is less. Less effort implies less service, and less service
implies less value. Each step of progress, then, annihilates value;
but how? Not by suppressing the useful effect, but by substituting
gratuitous for onerous utility, natural for social wealth. In
one sense the portion of value thus annihilated is excluded from
the domain of Political Economy, just as it is excluded from our
inventories. It is no longer exchanged, bought, or sold, and mankind
enjoy it without effort and almost without consciousness. It is no
longer accounted relative wealth, but is ranked among the gifts of
God.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, if science takes it no longer into
account, the error is assuredly committed of losing sight of what
<a id="p074" class="xxpn">[p074]</a> under all circumstances is the
main, the essential thing—the result, the <em class="e000I2">useful
effect</em>. In that case we overlook the strongest tendencies
towards community and equality, and discover much less of harmony
in the social order. If this book is destined to advance Political
Economy a single step, it will be by keeping constantly before the
eyes of the reader that portion of <em class="e000I2">value</em>
which is successively annihilated, and recovered, under the form of
<em class="e000I2">gratuitous utility</em>, by mankind at large.</p>

<p>I shall here make an observation which will prove how frequently
the sciences unite and nearly run into each other.</p>

<p>I have just defined <em class="e000I2">service</em>. It is
the <em class="e000I2">effort</em> in one man, while the <em
class="e000I2">want</em> and the <em class="e000I2">satisfaction</em>
are in another. Sometimes the service is rendered gratuitously,
without remuneration, without any service being exacted in return.
It proceeds, then, from the principle of sympathy rather than from
the principle of self-interest. It constitutes gift, not exchange.
Consequently it would seem to appertain not to Political Economy
(which is the theory of exchange), but to morals. In fact, acts
of that nature, by reason of their motive, are rather moral than
economical. We shall see, however, that, by reason of their effects,
they concern the science which now engages us. On the other hand,
services rendered for an onerous consideration, on condition of a
return, and, by reason of that motive (essentially economic), do not
on that account remain excluded from the domain of morals, in so far
as their effects are concerned.</p>

<p>Thus these two branches of knowledge have an infinite number of
points of contact; and as two truths cannot be antagonistic, when the
economist ascribes to a phenomenon injurious consequences, and the
moralist ascribes to it beneficial effects, we may affirm that one or
other of them is mistaken. It is thus that the sciences verify and
fortify one another. <a id="p075" class="xxpn">[p075]</a></p>

<h2 title="III. Wants of Man"><a id="III"></a>III.<br />
WANTS OF MAN.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
It is perhaps impossible, and, at any rate, it would not be of much
use, to present a complete and methodical catalogue of human
wants. Nearly all those which are of real importance are comprised
in the following enumeration:—</p>

<p>Respiration (I retain here that want, as marking the boundary
where the transmission of labour or exchange of services begins)—Food—Clothing—Lodging—Preservation
or re-establishment of
Health—Locomotion—Security—Instruction—Diversion—Sense
of the beautiful.</p>

<p>Wants exist. This is a fact. It would be puerile to inquire
whether we should have been better without wants, and why God
has made us subject to them.</p>

<p>It is certain that man <em class="e000I2">suffers</em>, and even dies, when he cannot
satisfy the wants which belong to his organization. It is certain
that he <em class="e000I2">suffers</em>, and may even die, when in satisfying certain of his
wants he indulges to excess.</p>

<p>We cannot satisfy the greater part of our wants without pain or
trouble, which may be considered as <em class="e000I2">suffering</em>. The same may be
said of the act by which, exercising a noble control over our
appetites, we impose on ourselves a privation.</p>

<p>Thus, <em class="e000I2">suffering</em> is inevitable, and there remains to us only a
choice of evils. Nothing comes more home to us than suffering,
and hence <em class="e000I2">personal interest</em>—the sentiment which is branded now-a-days
with the names of egotism and individualism—is indestructible.
Nature has placed <em class="e000I2">sensibility</em> at the extremity of our
nerves, and at all the avenues to the heart and mind, as an advanced
guard, to give us notice when our satisfactions are either
defective or in excess. Pain has, then, a purpose, a mission.
We are asked frequently, whether the existence of evil can be
reconciled with the infinite goodness of the Creator—a formidable
<a id="p076" class="xxpn">[p076]</a> problem that philosophy will always discuss, and never probably
be able to solve. As far as Political Economy is concerned, we
must take man as he is, inasmuch as it is not given to imagination
to figure to itself—far less can the reason conceive—a sentient
and mortal being exempt from pain. We should try in vain to
comprehend sensibility without pain, or man without sensibility.</p>

<p>In our days, certain sentimentalist schools reject as false all
social science which does not go the length of establishing a system
by means of which suffering may be banished from the world.
They pass a severe judgment on Political Economy because it admits,
what it is impossible to deny, the existence of suffering. They
go farther—they make Political Economy responsible for it. It is
as if they were to attribute the frailty of our organs to the physiologist
who makes them the object of his study.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly we may acquire a temporary popularity, attract
the regards of suffering classes, and irritate them against the
natural order of society, by telling them that we have in our head
a plan of artificial social arrangement which excludes pain in
every form. We may even pretend to appropriate God’s secret,
and to interpret His presumed will, by banishing evil from the
world. And there will not be wanting those who will treat as <em class="e000I2">impious</em>
a science which exposes such pretensions, and who will accuse
it of overlooking or denying the foresight of the Author of things.</p>

<p>These schools, at the same time, give us a frightful picture of
the actual state of society, not perceiving that if it be <em class="e000I2">impious</em> to
foresee suffering in the future, it is equally so to expose its existence
in the past or in the present. For the infinite admits of no limits;
and if a single human being has since the creation experienced
suffering, that fact would entitle us to admit, without <em class="e000I2">impiety</em>, that
suffering has entered into the plan of Providence.</p>

<p>Surely it is more philosophical and more manly to acknowledge
at once great natural facts which not only exist, but apart from
which we can form no just or adequate conception of human
nature.</p>

<p>Man, then, is subject to suffering, and consequently society is
also subject to it.</p>

<p>Suffering discharges a function in the individual, and consequently
in society.</p>

<p>An accurate investigation of the social laws discloses to us that
the mission of suffering is gradually to destroy its own causes, to
circumscribe suffering itself within narrower limits, and finally to
assure the preponderance of the Good and the Fair, by enabling
us to purchase or merit that preponderance. <a id="p077" class="xxpn">[p077]</a></p>

<p>The nomenclature we have proposed places material wants in
the foreground.</p>

<p>The times in which we live force me to put the reader on his
guard against a species of sentimental affectation which is now
much in vogue.</p>

<p>There are people who hold very cheap what they disdainfully
term <em class="e000I2">material wants</em>, <em class="e000I2">material satisfactions</em>: they will say, as Belise
says to Chrysale,</p>

<p>
“Le corps, cette guenille, est-il d’une importance,<br />
D’un prix à mériter seulement qu’on y pense?”<br />
</p>

<p>And although, in general, pretty well off themselves, they will
blame me for having indicated as one of our most pressing wants,
that of <em class="e000I2">food</em>, for example.</p>

<p>I acknowledge undoubtedly that moral advancement is a higher
thing than physical sustenance. But are we so stuffed with declamatory
affectation that we can no longer venture to say, that
before we can set about moral culture, we must have the means of
living. Let us guard ourselves against these puerilities, which
obstruct science. In wishing to pass for philanthropical we cease
to be truthful; for it is contrary both to reason and to fact to
represent moral development, self-respect, the cultivation of refined
sentiments, as preceding the requirements of simple preservation.
This sort of prudery is quite modern. Rousseau, that enthusiastic
panegyrist of the <em class="e000I2">State of Nature</em>, steered clear of it; and a man
endued with exquisite delicacy, of a tenderness of heart full of
unction, a spiritualist even to quietism, and, towards himself, a
stoic—I mean Fénélon—has said that, “After all, solidity of mind
consists in the desire to be exactly instructed as to how those
things are managed which lie at the foundation of human life—all
great affairs turn upon that.”</p>

<p>Without pretending, then, to classify our wants in a rigorously
exact order, we may say, that man cannot direct his efforts to the
satisfaction of moral wants of the highest and most elevated kind
until after he has provided for those which concern his preservation
and sustenance. Whence, without going farther, we may
conclude that every legislative measure which tells against the
material well-being of communities injures the moral life of nations,—a
<em class="e000I2">harmony</em> which I commend, in passing, to the attention of the
reader.</p>

<p>And since the occasion presents itself, I will here mark another.</p>

<p>Since the inexorable necessities of material life are an obstacle
to moral and intellectual culture, it follows that we ought to find
more virtue among wealthy than among poor nations and classes.
<a id="p078" class="xxpn">[p078]</a> Good Heaven! what have I just said, and with what clamour shall
I be assailed! But the truth is, it is a perfect mania of our times
to attribute all disinterestedness, all self-sacrifice, all which constitutes
the greatness and moral beauty of man, to the poorer classes,
and this mania has of late been still more developed by a revolution,
which, bringing these classes to the surface of society, has not
failed to surround them with a crowd of flatterers.</p>

<p>I don’t deny that wealth, opulence, especially where it is very
unequally spread, tends to develop certain special vices.</p>

<p>But is it possible to admit as a general proposition that virtue
is the privilege of poverty, and vice the unhappy and unfailing
companion of ease? This would be to affirm that moral and intellectual
improvement, which is only compatible with a certain
amount of leisure and comfort, is detrimental to intelligence and
morality.</p>

<p>I appeal to the candour of the suffering classes themselves. To
what horrible <em class="e000I2">dissonances</em> would such a paradox conduct us!</p>

<p>We must then conclude, that human nature has the frightful
alternative presented to it, either to remain eternally wretched, or
advance gradually on the road to vice and immorality. Then all
the forces which conduct us to wealth—such as activity, economy,
skill, honesty—are the seeds of vice; while those which tie us to
poverty—improvidence, idleness, dissipation, carelessness—are the
precious germs of virtue. Could we conceive in the moral world
a dissonance more discouraging? Or, were it really so, who would
dare to address or counsel the people? You complain of your
sufferings (we must say to them), and you are impatient to see an
end of these sufferings. You groan at finding yourselves under
the yoke of the most imperious material wants, and you sigh for
the hour of your deliverance, for you desire leisure to make your
voice heard in the political world and to protect your interests.
You know not what you desire, or how fatal success would prove
to you. Ease, competence, riches, develop only vice. Guard,
then, religiously your poverty and your virtue.</p>

<p>The flatterers of the people, then, fall into a manifest contradiction
when they point to the region of opulence as an impure sink
of egotism and vice, and, at the same time, urge them on—and
frequently in their eagerness by the most illegitimate means—to
a region which they deem so unfortunate.</p>

<p>Such discordances are never encountered in the natural order of
society. It is impossible to suppose that all men should aspire to
competence, that the natural way to attain it should be by the
exercise of the strictest virtue, and that they should reach it <a id="p079" class="xxpn">[p079]</a>
nevertheless
only to be caught in the snares of vice. Such declamations
are calculated only to light up and keep alive the hatred of classes.
If true, they place human nature in a dilemma between poverty
and immorality. If untrue, they make falsehood the minister of
disorder, and set to loggerheads classes who should mutually love
and assist each other.</p>

<p>Factitious inequality—inequality generated by law, by disturbing
the natural order of development of the different classes of
society—is, for all, a prolific source of irritation, jealousy, and
crime. This is the reason why it is necessary to satisfy ourselves
whether this natural order leads to the progressive amelioration
and progressive equalization of all classes; and we should be
arrested in this inquiry by what lawyers term a <em class="e000I2">fin de non-recevoir</em>,
a peremptory exception, if this double material progress implied
necessarily a double moral degradation.</p>

<p>Upon the subject of human wants I have to make an important
observation,—and one which, in Political Economy, may even be
regarded as fundamental,—it is, that wants are not a fixed immutable
quantity. They are not in their nature stationary, but
progressive.</p>

<p>We remark this characteristic even in our strictly physical
wants; but it becomes more apparent as we rise to those desires
and intellectual tastes which distinguish man from the inferior
animals.</p>

<p>It would seem that if there be anything in which men should
resemble each other, it is in the want of food, for, unless in exceptional
cases, men’s stomachs are very much alike.</p>

<p>And yet aliments which are <em class="e000I2">recherchés</em> at one period become
vulgar at another, and the regimen which suits a Lazzarone would
subject a Dutchman to torture. Thus the want which is the most
immediate, the grossest of all, and consequently the most uniform
of all, still varies according to age, sex, temperament, climate,
custom.</p>

<p>The same may be said of all our other wants. Scarcely has a
man found shelter than he desires to be lodged, scarcely is he
clothed than he wishes to be decorated, scarcely has he satisfied
his bodily cravings than study, science, art, open to his desires an
unlimited field.</p>

<p>It is a phenomenon well worthy of remark, how quickly, by
continuous satisfaction, what was at first only a vague desire
becomes a taste, and what was only a taste is transformed into
a want, and even a want of the most imperious kind.</p>

<p>Look at that rude artizan. Accustomed to poor fare, plain
<a id="p080" class="xxpn">[p080]</a> clothing, indifferent lodging, he imagines he would be the happiest
of men, and would have no farther desires, if he could but reach
the step of the ladder immediately above him. He is astonished
that those who have already reached it should still torment themselves
as they do. At length comes the modest fortune he has
dreamt of, and then he is happy, very happy—for a few days.</p>

<p>For soon he becomes familiar with his new situation, and by
degrees he ceases to feel his fancied happiness. With indifference
he puts on the fine clothing after which he sighed. He has got
into a new circle, he associates with other companions, he drinks
of another cup, he aspires to mount another step, and if he ever
turns his reflections at all upon himself, he feels that if his fortune
has changed, his soul remains the same, and is still an inexhaustible
spring of new desires.</p>

<p>It would seem that nature has attached this singular power to
<em class="e000I2">habit</em>, in order that it should be in us what a rochet-wheel is in
mechanics, and that humanity, urged on continually to higher and
higher regions, should not be able to rest content, whatever degree
of civilisation it attains to.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">sense of dignity</em>, the feeling of self-respect, acts with perhaps
still more force in the same direction. The stoic philosophy has
frequently blamed men for desiring rather to <em class="e000I2">appear</em> than to <em class="e000I2">be</em>.
But, taking a broader view of things, is it certain that to <em class="e000I2">appear</em> is
not for man one of the modes of <em class="e000I2">being</em>?</p>

<p>When, by exertion, order, and economy, a family rises by
degrees towards those social regions where tastes become nicer
and more delicate, relations more polished, sentiments more refined,
intelligence more cultivated, who can describe the acute
suffering which accompanies a forced return to their former low
estate? The body does not alone suffer. The sad reverse interferes
with habits which have become as it were a second nature;
it clashes with the sense of dignity, and all the feelings of the soul.
It is by no means uncommon in such a case to see the victim sink
all at once into degrading sottishness, or perish in despair. It is
with the social medium as with the atmosphere. The mountaineer,
accustomed to the pure air of his native hills, pines and
moulders away in the narrow streets of our cities.</p>

<p>But I hear some one exclaim, Economist, you stumble already.
You have just told us that your science is in accord with morals,
and here you are justifying luxury and effeminacy. Philosopher,
I say in my turn, lay aside these fine clothes, which were not those
of primitive man, break your furniture, burn your books, dine on
raw flesh, and I shall then reply to your objection. It is too much
<a id="p081" class="xxpn">[p081]</a> to quarrel with this power of habit, of which you are yourself the
living example.</p>

<p>We may find fault with this disposition which Nature has given
to our organs; but our censure will not make it the less universal.
We find it existing among all nations, ancient and modern, savage
and civilized, at the antipodes as at home. We cannot explain
civilisation without it; and when a disposition of the human heart
is thus proved to be universal and indestructible, social science
cannot put it aside, or refuse to take it into account.</p>

<p>This objection will be made by publicists who pride themselves
on being the disciples of Rousseau; but Rousseau has never denied
the existence of the phenomenon. He establishes undeniably the
indefinite elasticity of human wants, and the power of habit, and
admits even the part which I assign to them in preventing the
human race from retrograding; only, that which I admire is what
he deplores, and he does so consistently. Rousseau fancied there
was a time when men had neither rights, nor duties, nor relations,
nor affections, nor language; and it was then, according to him,
that they were happy and perfect. He was bound, therefore, to
abhor the social machinery which is constantly removing mankind
from ideal perfection. Those, on the contrary, who are of opinion
that perfection is not at the beginning, but at the end, of the
human evolution, will admire the spring and motive of action
which I place in the foreground. But as to the existence and
play of the spring itself we are at one.</p>

<p>“Men of leisure,” he says, “employed themselves in procuring
all sorts of conveniences and accommodations unknown to their
forefathers, and that was the first yoke which, without intending
it, they imposed upon themselves, and the prime source of the
inconveniences which they prepared for their descendants. For,
not only did they thus continue to emasculate both mind and
body, but these luxuries having <em class="e000I2">by habit</em> lost all their relish, and
degenerated into <em class="e000I2">true wants</em>, their being deprived of them caused
more pain than the possession of them had given pleasure: they
were unhappy at losing what they had no enjoyment in possessing.”</p>

<p>Rousseau was convinced that God, nature, and humanity were
wrong. That is still the opinion of many; but it is not mine.</p>

<p>After all, God forbid that I should desire to set myself against
the noblest attribute, the most beautiful virtue of man, self-control,
command over his passions, moderation in his desires, contempt of
show. I don’t say that he is to make himself a slave to this or
that factitious want. I say that wants (taking a broad and general
<a id="p082" class="xxpn">[p082]</a> view of them as resulting from man’s mental and bodily constitution),
combined with the power of habit, and the sense of
dignity, are indefinitely expansible, because they spring from an
inexhaustible source—namely, desire. Who should blame a rich
man for being sober, for despising finery, for avoiding pomp and
effeminacy? But are there not more elevated desires to which
he may yield? Has the desire for instruction, for instance, any
limits? To render service to his country, to encourage the arts, to
disseminate useful ideas, to succour the distressed,—is there anything
in these incompatible with the right use of riches?</p>

<p>For the rest, whatever philosophers may think of it, human
wants do not constitute a fixed immutable quantity. That is a
certain, a universal fact, liable to no exception. The wants of the
fourteenth century, whether with reference to food, or lodging, or
instruction, were not at all the wants of ours, and we may safely
predict that ours will not be the wants of our descendants.</p>

<p>The same observation applies to all the elements of Political
Economy—Wealth, Labour, Value, Services, etc.,—all participate
in the extreme versatility of the principal subject, Man. Political
Economy has not, like geometry or physics, the advantage of
dealing with objects which can be weighed or measured. This is
one of its difficulties to begin with, and it is a perpetual source of
errors throughout; for when the human mind applies itself to a
certain order of phenomena, it is naturally on the outlook for a
<em class="e000I2">criterion</em>, a common measure, to which everything can be referred,
in order to give to that particular branch of knowledge the character
of an <em class="e000I2">exact science</em>. Thus we observe some authors seeking
for fixity in <em class="e000I2">value</em>, others in <em class="e000I2">money</em>, others in <em class="e000I2">corn</em>, others in <em class="e000I2">labour</em>,
that is to say, in things which are themselves all liable to fluctuation.</p>

<p>Many errors in Political Economy proceed from authors thus
regarding human wants as a fixed determinate quantity; and it is
for this reason that I have deemed it my duty to enlarge on this
subject. At the risk of anticipating, it is worth while to notice
briefly this mode of reasoning. Economists take generally the
enjoyments which satisfy men of the present day, and they assume
that human nature admits of no other. Hence, if the bounty of
nature, or the power of machinery, or habits of temperance and
moderation, succeed in rendering disposable for a time a portion of
human labour, this progress disquiets them, they consider it as a
disaster, and they retreat behind absurd but specious formulas, such
as these: <em class="e000I2">Production is superabundant</em>,—<em class="e000I2">we suffer from plethora</em>,—<em class="e000I2">the
power of producing outruns the power of consuming</em>, etc. <a id="p083" class="xxpn">[p083]</a></p>

<p>It is not possible to discover a solution of the question of
<em class="e000I2">machinery</em>, or that of <em class="e000I2">external competition</em>, or that of <em class="e000I2">luxury</em>, if
we persist in considering our <em class="e000I2">wants</em> as a fixed invariable quantity,
and do not take into account their indefinite expansibility.</p>

<p>But if human <em class="e000I2">wants</em> are indefinite, progressive, capable of increase,
like desire, which is their never failing source, we must
admit, under pain of introducing discordance and contradiction
into the economical laws of society, that nature has placed in man
and around him indefinite and progressive means of <em class="e000I2">satisfaction</em>;—equilibrium
between the means and the end being the primary condition
of all harmony. This is what we shall now examine.</p>

<p>I said at the outset of this work that the object of Political
Economy is <em class="e000I2">man</em>, considered with reference to his wants, and his
means of satisfying these wants.</p>

<p>We must then begin with the study of man and his organization.</p>

<p>But we have also seen that he is not a solitary being. If his
<em class="e000I2">wants</em> and his <em class="e000I2">satisfactions</em> are, from the very nature of sensibility,
inseparable from his being, the same thing cannot be said of his
<em class="e000I2">efforts</em>, which spring from the active principle. The latter are susceptible
of transmission. In a word, men work for one another.</p>

<p>Now a very strange thing takes place.</p>

<p>If we take a general, or, if I may be allowed the expression,
abstract view, of man, his wants, his efforts, his satisfactions, his
constitution, his inclinations, his tendencies, we fall into a train of
observation which appears free from doubt and self-evident,—so
much so, that the writer finds a difficulty in submitting to the
public judgment truths so vulgar and so palpable. He is afraid
of provoking ridicule; and thinks, not without reason, that the
impatient reader will throw away his book, exclaiming, “I shall
not waste time on such trivialities.”</p>

<p>And yet these truths which, when presented to us in an abstract
shape, we regard as so incontrovertible that we can scarce summon
patience to listen to them, are considered only as ridiculous
errors and absurd theories the moment they are applied to man in
his social state. Regarding man as an isolated being, who ever
took it into his head to say, “Production is superabundant—the
power of consumption cannot keep pace with the power of production—luxury
and factitious tastes are the source of wealth—the
invention of machinery annihilates labour,” and other apophthegms
of the same sort,—which, nevertheless, when applied to mankind in
the aggregate, we receive as axioms so well established that they
are actually made the basis of our commercial and industrial legislation?
<em class="e000I2">Exchange</em> produces in this respect an illusion of which
<a id="p084" class="xxpn">[p084]</a> even men of penetration and solid judgment find it impossible to
disabuse themselves, and I affirm that Political Economy will have
attained its design, and fulfilled its mission, when it shall have conclusively
demonstrated this:—that what is true of an individual
man is true of society at large. Man in an isolated state is at
once producer and consumer, inventor and projector, capitalist and
workman. All the economic phenomena are accomplished in his
person—he is, as it were, society in miniature. In like manner,
humanity, viewed in the aggregate, may be regarded as a great,
collective, complex individual, to whom you may apply exactly the
same truths as to man in a state of isolation.</p>

<p>I have felt it necessary to make this remark, which I hope will
be justified in the sequel, before continuing what I had to say upon
man. I should have been afraid, otherwise, that the reader might
reject, as superfluous, the following developments, which in fact
are nothing else than veritable <em class="e000I2">truisms</em>.</p>

<p>I have just spoken of the <em class="e000I2">wants</em> of man, and after presenting an
approximate enumeration of them, I observed that they were not
of a stationary, but of a progressive nature; and this holds true,
whether we consider these wants each singly, or all together, in
their physical, intellectual, and moral order. How could it be
otherwise? There are wants the satisfaction of which is exacted
by our organization under pain of death, and up to a certain point
we may represent these as fixed quantities, although that is not
rigorously exact, for however little we may desire to neglect an
essential element—namely, the <em class="e000I2">force of habit</em>—however little we
may condescend to subject ourselves to honest self-examination,
we shall be forced to allow that wants, even of the plainest and
most homely kind (the desire for food, for example), undergo, under
the influence of habit, undoubted transformations. The man who
declaims against this observation as materialist and epicurean,
would think himself very unfortunate, if, taking him at his word,
we should reduce him to the black broth of the Spartans, or the
scanty pittance of an anchorite. At all events, when wants of
this kind have been satisfied in an assured and permanent way,
there are others which take their rise in the most expansible of
our faculties, desire. Can we conceive a time when man can no
longer form even reasonable desires? Let us not forget that a
desire which might be unreasonable in a former state of civilisation—at
a time when all the human faculties were absorbed in providing
for low material wants—ceases to be so when improvement
opens to these faculties a more extended field. A desire to travel
at the rate of thirty miles an hour would have been unreasonable
<a id="p085" class="xxpn">[p085]</a> two centuries ago—it is not so at the present day. To pretend
that the wants and desires of man are fixed and stationary quantities,
is to mistake the nature of the human soul, to deny facts,
and to render civilisation inexplicable.</p>

<p>It would still be inexplicable if, side by side with the indefinite
development of wants, there had not been placed, as possible, the
indefinite development of the means of providing for these wants.
How could the expansible nature of our wants have contributed
to the realization of progress, if, at a certain point, our faculties
could advance no farther, and should encounter an impassable
barrier?</p>

<p>Our wants being indefinite, the presumption is that the means
of satisfying these wants should be indefinite also, unless we are to
suppose Nature, Providence, or the Power which presides over our
destinies, to have fallen into a cruel and shocking contradiction.</p>

<p>I say indefinite, not infinite, for nothing connected with man is
infinite. It is precisely because our faculties go on developing
themselves <em class="e000I2">ad infinitum</em>, that they have no assignable limits,
although they may have absolute limits. There are many points
above the present range of humanity, which we may never succeed
in attaining, and yet for all that, the time may never come
when we shall cease to approach nearer them.<a
href="#FN_22" id="FNa_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>I don’t at all mean to say that <em class="e000I2">desire</em>, and the <em class="e000I2">means</em> of satisfying
desire, march in parallel lines and with equal rapidity. The
former runs—the latter limps after it.</p>

<p>The prompt and adventurous nature of desire, compared with
the slowness of our faculties, shews us very clearly that in every
stage of civilisation, at every step of our progress, suffering to a
certain extent is, and ever must be, the lot of man. But it shews
us likewise that this suffering has a mission, for desire could no
longer be an incentive to our faculties if it followed, in place of
preceding, their exercise. Let us not, however, accuse nature of
cruelty in the construction of this mechanism, for we cannot fail to
remark that desire is never transformed into want, strictly so called,
that is, into <em class="e000I2">painful desire</em>, until it has been made such by <em class="e000I2">habit</em>;
in other words, until the <em class="e000I2">means</em> of satisfying the desire have been
found and placed irrevocably within our reach.<a
href="#FN_23" id="FNa_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> <a id="p086" class="xxpn">[p086]</a></p>

<p>We have now to examine the question,—What means have we
of providing for our wants?</p>

<p>It seems evident to me that there are two—namely, Nature and
Labour, the gifts of God, and the fruits of our efforts—or, if you
will, the application of our faculties to the things which Nature
has placed at our service.</p>

<p>No school that I know of has attributed the satisfaction of our
wants to Nature <em class="e000I2">alone</em>. Such an assertion is clearly contradicted
by experience, and we need not learn Political Economy to perceive
that the intervention of our <em class="e000I2">faculties</em> is necessary.</p>

<p>But there are schools who have attributed this privilege to
Labour alone. Their axiom is, “All wealth comes from labour—labour
is wealth.”</p>

<p>I cannot help anticipating, so far as to remark, that these
formulas, taken literally, have led to monstrous errors of doctrine,
and, consequently, to deplorable legislative blunders. I shall
return to this subject. I confine myself here to establishing, as a
fact, that <em class="e000I2">Nature</em> and <em class="e000I2">Labour</em> co-operate for the satisfaction of our
wants and desires.</p>

<p>Let us examine the facts.</p>

<p>The first want which we have placed at the head of our list is
that of <em class="e000I2">breathing</em>. As regards respiration, we have already shown
that <em class="e000I2">nature</em> in general is at the whole cost, and that human <em class="e000I2">labour</em>
intervenes only in certain exceptional cases, as where it becomes
necessary to purify the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Another want is that of quenching our <em class="e000I2">thirst</em>, and it is more or
less satisfied by Nature, in as far as she furnishes us with water,
more or less pure, abundant, and within reach; and Labour concurs
in as far as it becomes necessary to bring water from a greater
distance, to filter it, or to obviate its scarcity by constructing wells
and cisterns.</p>

<p>The liberality of Nature towards us in regard to <em class="e000I2">food</em> is by no
means uniform; for who will maintain, that the labour to be furnished
is the same when the land is fertile, or when it is sterile,
when the forest abounds with game, the river with fish, or in the
opposite cases?</p>

<p>As regards <em class="e000I2">lighting</em>, human labour has certainly less to do when
the night is short than when it is long.</p>

<p>I dare not lay it down as an absolute rule, but it appears to me
that in proportion as we rise in the scale of wants, the co-operation
of Nature is lessened, and leaves us more room for the exercise of our
faculties. The painter, the sculptor, and the author even, are forced
to avail themselves of materials and instruments which Nature alone
<a id="p087" class="xxpn">[p087]</a> furnishes, but from their own genius is derived all that makes the
charm, the merit, the utility, and the value of their works. <em class="e000I2">To
learn</em> is a want which the well-directed exercise of our faculties
almost alone can satisfy. Yet here <em class="e000I2">Nature</em> assists, by presenting
to us in divers degrees objects of observation and comparison.
With an equal amount of application, may not botany, geology, or
natural history, make everywhere equal progress?</p>

<p>It would be superfluous to cite other examples. We have
already shown undeniably that Nature gives us the means of satisfaction,
in placing at our disposal things possessed of higher or
lower degrees of <em class="e000I2">utility</em> (I use the word in its etymological sense,
as indicating the <em class="e000I2">property of serving</em>, of being <em class="e000I2">useful</em>). In many
cases, in almost every case, labour must contribute, to a certain
extent, in rendering this <em class="e000I2">utility</em> complete; and we can easily comprehend
that the part which labour has to perform is greater or
less in proportion as Nature had previously advanced the operation
in a less or greater degree.</p>

<p>We may then lay down these two formulas:</p>

<p>1. <em class="e000I2">Utility is communicated sometimes by Nature alone, sometimes
by Labour alone, but almost always by the co-operation of both</em>.</p>

<p>2. <em class="e000I2">To bring anything to its highest degree of</em> <em class="e0U003">UTILITY</em>, <em class="e000I2">the action
of Labour is in an inverse ratio to the action of Nature</em>.</p>

<p>From these two propositions, combined with what I have said
of the indefinite expansibility of our wants, I may be permitted to
deduce a conclusion, the importance of which will be demonstrated
in the sequel. Suppose two men, having no connexion with each
other, to be unequally situated in this respect, that Nature had been
liberal to the one, and niggardly to the other; the first would
evidently obtain a given amount of satisfaction at a less expense
of labour. Would it follow that the part of his forces thus left
<em class="e000I2">disposable</em>, if I may use the expression, would be abandoned to
inaction? and that this man, on account of the liberality of Nature,
would be reduced to compulsory idleness? Not at all. It would
follow that he could, if he wished it, dispose of these forces to
enlarge the circle of his enjoyments; that with an equal amount
of labour he could procure two satisfactions in place of one; in a
word, that his progress would become more easy.</p>

<p>I may be mistaken, but it appears to me that no science, not
even geometry, is founded on truths more unassailable. Were any
one to prove to me that all these truths were so many errors, I
should not only lose confidence in them, but all faith in evidence
itself; for what reasoning could one employ which should better
deserve the acquiescence of our judgment than the evidence thus
<a id="p088" class="xxpn">[p088]</a> overturned? The moment an axiom is discovered which shall
contradict this other axiom—that a straight line is the shortest
road from one point to another—that instant the human mind has
no other refuge, if it be a refuge, than absolute scepticism.</p>

<p>I positively feel ashamed thus to insist upon first principles
which are so plain as to seem puerile. And yet we must confess
that, amid the complications of human transactions, such simple
truths have been overlooked; and in order to justify myself for
detaining the reader so long upon what the English call <em class="e000I2">truisms</em>,
I shall notice here a singular error by which excellent minds have
allowed themselves to be misled. Setting aside, neglecting entirely,
the <em class="e000I2">co-operation of Nature</em> in relation to the satisfaction of
our wants, they have laid down the absolute principle that <em class="e000I2">all
wealth comes from labour</em>. On this foundation they have reared
the following erroneous syllogism:</p>

<p>“All wealth comes from labour:</p>

<p>“Wealth, then, is in proportion to labour.</p>

<p>“But labour is in an inverse ratio to the liberality of Nature:</p>

<p>“<em class="e000I2">Ergo</em>, wealth is inversely as the liberality of Nature.”</p>

<p>Right or wrong, many economical laws owe their origin to this
singular reasoning. Such laws cannot be otherwise than subversive
of every sound principle in relation to the development and
distribution of wealth; and this it is which justifies me in preparing
beforehand, by the explanation of truths very trivial in appearance,
for the refutation of the deplorable errors and prejudices under
which society is now labouring.</p>

<p>Let us analyze the co-operation of Nature of which I have
spoken. Nature places two things at our disposal—<em class="e000I2">materials</em> and
<em class="e000I2">forces</em>.</p>

<p>Most of the material objects which contribute to the satisfaction
of our wants and desires are brought into the state of <em class="e000I2">utility</em> which
renders them fit for our use only by the intervention of labour, by
the application of the human faculties. But the elements, the
atoms, if you will, of which these objects are composed, are the
gifts, I will add the <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> gifts, of Nature. This observation
is of the very highest importance, and will, I believe, throw a new
light upon the theory of wealth.</p>

<p>The reader will have the goodness to bear in mind that I am
inquiring at present in a general way into the moral and physical
constitution of man, his wants, his faculties, his relations with
Nature—apart from the consideration of Exchange, which I shall
enter upon in the next chapter. We shall then see in what respect,
and in what manner, social transactions modify the phenomena. <a id="p089" class="xxpn">[p089]</a></p>

<p>It is very evident, that if man in an isolated state must, so to
speak, <em class="e000I2">purchase</em> the greater part of his satisfactions by an exertion,
by an effort, it is rigorously exact to say that prior to the intervention
of any such exertion, any such effort, the materials which
he finds at his disposal are the <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> gifts of Nature. After
the first effort on his part, however slight it may be, they cease
to be <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>; and if the language of Political Economy had
been always exact, it would have been to material objects in
this state, and before human labour had been bestowed upon
them, that the term <em class="e000I2">raw materials</em> (<em class="e000I2">matières premières</em>) would have
been exclusively applied.</p>

<p>I repeat that this <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> quality of the gifts of Nature, anterior
to the intervention of labour, is of the very highest importance.
I said in my second chapter that Political Economy was the <em class="e000I2">theory
of value</em>; I add now, and by anticipation, that things begin to
possess <em class="e000I2">value</em> only when it is given to them by labour. I intend
to demonstrate afterwards that everything which is <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> for
man in an isolated state is gratuitous for man in his social condition,
and that the gratuitous gifts of Nature, <em class="e000I2">whatever be their</em>
<em class="e0U003">UTILITY</em>, have no value. I say that a man who receives a benefit
from Nature, directly and without any effort on his part, cannot be
considered as rendering himself an <em class="e000I2">onerous service</em>, and, consequently,
that he cannot render to another any service with reference to
things which are common to all. Now, where there are no
services rendered and received there is no <em class="e000I2">value</em>.</p>

<p>All that I have said of <em class="e000I2">materials</em> is equally applicable to the
<em class="e000I2">forces</em> which Nature places at our disposal. Gravitation, the elasticity
of air, the power of the winds, the laws of equilibrium,
vegetable life, animal life, are so many forces which we learn to
turn to account. The pains and intelligence which we bestow in
this way always admit of remuneration, for we are not bound to
devote our efforts to the advantage of others gratuitously. But
these natural forces, in themselves, and apart from all intellectual
or bodily exertion, are <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> gifts of Providence, and in this
respect they remain destitute of <em class="e000I2">value</em> through all the complications
of human transactions. This is the leading idea of the present
work.</p>

<p>This observation would be of little importance, I allow, if the
co-operation of Nature were constantly uniform, if each man, at all
times, in all places, in all circumstances, received from Nature
equal and invariable assistance. In that case, science would be
justified in not taking into account an element which, remaining
always and everywhere the same, would affect the services
<a id="p090" class="xxpn">[p090]</a> exchanged in equal proportions on both sides. As in geometry we
eliminate portions of lines common to two figures which we compare
with each other, we might neglect a co-operation which is
invariably present, and content ourselves with saying, as we have
done hitherto, “There is such a thing as natural wealth—Political
Economy acknowledges it, and has no more concern with it.”</p>

<p>But this is not the true state of the matter. The irresistible
tendency of the human mind, stimulated by self-interest and
assisted by a series of discoveries, is to substitute natural and
gratuitous co-operation for human and onerous concurrence; so
that a given utility, although remaining the same as far as the
result and the satisfactions which it procures us are concerned,
represents a smaller and smaller amount of labour. In fact, it is
impossible not to perceive the immense influence of this marvellous
phenomenon on our notion of value. For what is the result of it?
This, that in every product the <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> element tends to take
the place of the <em class="e000I2">onerous</em>; that <em class="e000I2">utility</em>, being the result of two
<em class="e000I2">collaborations</em>, of which one is remunerated and the other is not,
Value, which has relation only to the first of these united forces,
is diminished, and makes room for a <em class="e000I2">utility</em> which is identically the
same, and this in proportion as we succeed in constraining Nature
to a more efficacious co-operation. So that we may say that
mankind have as many more <em class="e000I2">satisfactions</em>, as much more <em class="e000I2">wealth</em>,
as they have less <em class="e000I2">value</em>. Now, the majority of authors having
employed these three terms, <em class="e000I2">utility</em>, <em class="e000I2">wealth</em>, <em class="e000I2">value</em>, as synonymous, the
result has been a theory which is not only not true, but the reverse
of true. I believe sincerely that a more exact description of this
combination of natural forces and human forces in the business of
production, in other words, a juster definition of Value, would put
an end to inextricable theoretical confusion, and would reconcile
schools which are now divergent; and if I am now anticipating
somewhat in entering on this subject here, my justification with
the reader is the necessity of explaining in the outset certain ideas
of which otherwise he would have difficulty in perceiving the
importance.</p>

<p>Returning from this digression, I resume what I had to say
upon man considered exclusively in an economical point of view.</p>

<p>Another observation, which we owe to J. B. Say, and which is
almost self-evident, although too much neglected by many authors,
is, that man <em class="e000I2">creates</em> neither the <em class="e000I2">materials</em> nor the <em class="e000I2">forces</em> of nature,
if we take the word <em class="e000I2">create</em> in its exact signification. These materials,
these forces, have an independent existence. Man can
only combine them or displace them, for his own benefit or that
<a id="p091" class="xxpn">[p091]</a> of others. If for his own, <em class="e000I2">he renders a service to himself</em>,—if for
the benefit of others, <em class="e000I2">he renders service to his fellows</em>, and has the
right to exact an <em class="e000I2">equivalent</em> service. Whence it also follows that
<em class="e000I2">value</em> is proportional to the service rendered, and not at all to the
absolute <em class="e000I2">utility</em> of the thing. For this <em class="e000I2">utility</em> may be in great
part the result of the <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> action of Nature, in which case the
human service, the onerous service, the service to be remunerated,
is of little value. This results from the axiom above established—namely,
that <em class="e000I2">to bring a thing to the highest degree of utility, the
action of man is inversely as the action of Nature</em>.</p>

<p>This observation overturns the doctrine which places value in the
<em class="e000I2">materiality</em> of things. The contrary is the truth. The materiality is
a quality given by Nature, and consequently <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>, and devoid
of <em class="e000I2">value</em>, although of incontestable utility. Human action, which
can never succeed in <em class="e000I2">creating</em> matter, constitutes alone the service
which man in a state of isolation renders to himself, or that men
in society render to each other; and it is the free appreciation of
these <em class="e000I2">services</em> which is the foundation of <em class="e000I2">value</em>. Far, then, from
concluding with Adam Smith that it is impossible to conceive of
value otherwise than as residing in material substance, we conclude
that between Matter and Value there is no possible relation.</p>

<p>This erroneous doctrine Smith deduced logically from his principle,
that those classes alone are <em class="e000I2">productive</em> who operate on material
substances. He thus prepared the way for the modern error
of the <em class="e000I2">socialists</em>, who have never done representing as <em class="e000I2">unproductive</em>
parasites those whom they term <em class="e000I2">intermediaries</em> between the producer
and consumer—the merchant, the retail dealer, etc. Do
they render services? Do they save us trouble by taking trouble
for us? In that case they create <em class="e000I2">value</em>, although they do not
create matter; and as no one can create matter, and we all confine
our exertions to rendering reciprocal services, we pronounce
with justice that all, including agriculturists and manufacturers,
are <em class="e000I2">intermediaries</em> in relation one to another.</p>

<p>This is what I had to say at present upon the co-operation of
Nature. Nature places at our disposal, in various degrees, depending
on climate, seasons, and the advance of knowledge, but
<em class="e000I2">always gratuitously</em>, materials and forces. Then these materials
and forces are devoid of <em class="e000I2">value</em>; it would be strange if they had
any. According to what rule should we estimate them? In what
way could Nature be paid, remunerated, compensated? We shall
see afterwards that <em class="e000I2">exchange</em> is necessary in order to determine
<em class="e000I2">value</em>. We don’t purchase the goods of Nature—we gather them;
and if, in order to appropriate them, a certain amount of effort is
<a id="p092" class="xxpn">[p092]</a> necessary, it is in this <em class="e000I2">effort</em>, not in the gifts of Nature, that the
principle of <em class="e000I2">value</em> resides.</p>

<p>Let us now consider that action of man which we designate, in
a general way, by the term <em class="e000I2">labour</em>.</p>

<p>The word <em class="e000I2">labour</em>, like almost all the terms of Political Economy,
is very vague. Different authors use it in a sense more or less extended.
Political Economy has not had, like most other sciences,
Chemistry for example, the advantage of constructing her own
vocabulary. Treating of subjects which have been familiar to
men’s thoughts since the beginning of the world, and the constant
subject of their daily talk, she has found a nomenclature ready
made, and has been forced to adopt it.</p>

<p>The meaning of the word <em class="e000I2">labour</em> is often limited exclusively to
the muscular action of man upon materials. Hence those who
execute the mechanical part of production are called the <em class="e000I2">working
classes</em>.</p>

<p>The reader will comprehend that I give to this word a more
extended sense. I understand by <em class="e000I2">labour</em> the
application of our faculties to the satisfaction of our wants.
<em class="e000I2">Wants</em>, <em class="e000I2">efforts</em>,
<em class="e000I2">satisfactions</em>, this is the circle of
Political Economy. <em class="e000I2">Effort</em> may be physical,
intellectual, or even moral, as we shall immediately see.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to demonstrate in this place that all our
organs, all or nearly all our faculties, may concur, and, in point of
fact, do concur, in production. Attention, sagacity, intelligence,
imagination, have assuredly their part in it.</p>

<p>M. Dunoyer, in his excellent work, <em class="e000I2">Sur la Liberté du Travail</em>,
has included, and with scientific exactness, our moral faculties
among the elements to which we are indebted for our wealth—an
idea as original and suggestive as it is just. It is destined to
enlarge and ennoble the field of Political Economy.</p>

<p>I shall not dwell here upon that idea farther than as it may
enable me to throw a faint light upon the origin of a powerful
agent of production, of which I shall have occasion to speak hereafter—I
mean <em class="e000I2">Capital</em>.</p>

<p>If we examine in succession the material objects which contribute
to the satisfaction of our wants, we shall discover without
difficulty that all or nearly all require, in order to their being
brought to perfection, more time, a larger portion of our life, than
a man can expend without recruiting his strength, that is to say,
without satisfying his wants. This supposes that those who had
made those things had previously reserved, set aside, accumulated,
provisions, to enable them to subsist during the operation. <a id="p093" class="xxpn">[p093]</a></p>

<p>The same observation applies to satisfactions which have nothing
material belonging to them.</p>

<p>A clergyman cannot devote himself to preaching, a professor
to teaching, a magistrate to the maintenance of order, unless, by
themselves, or by others, they are put in possession of means of
subsistence previously created.</p>

<p>Let us go a little higher. Suppose a man isolated and forced to
live by the chase. It is easy to comprehend that if every night he
consumed the whole game which his day’s hunting had furnished,
he could never set himself to any other work, to build a cottage,
for example, or repair his arms or implements. All progress would
be interdicted in his case.</p>

<p>This is not the proper place to define the nature and functions
of Capital. My sole object at present is to show that certain
moral virtues co-operate very directly in the amelioration of our
condition, even when viewed exclusively with reference to wealth,—among
other virtues, order, foresight, self-control, economy.</p>

<p>To <em class="e000I2">foresee</em> is one of our noblest privileges, and it is scarcely
necessary to say that, in all situations of life, the man who most
clearly foresees the probable consequences of his acts and determinations
has the best chance of success.</p>

<p>To <em class="e000I2">control his appetites</em>, to govern his passions, to sacrifice the
present to the future, to submit to privations for the sake of greater
but more distant advantages—such are the conditions essential to
the formation of capital; and capital, as we have already partially
seen, is itself the essential condition of all labour that is in any
degree complicated or prolonged. It is quite evident that if we
suppose two men placed in identically the same position, and
possessed of the same amount of intelligence and activity, that
man would make the most progress who, having accumulated
provisions, had placed himself in a situation to undertake protracted
works, to improve his implements, and thus to make the
forces of nature co-operate in the realization of his designs.</p>

<p>I shall not dwell longer on this. We have only to look around
us to be convinced that all our forces, all our faculties, all our virtues,
concur in furthering the advancement of man and of society.</p>

<p>For the same reason, there are none of our vices which are not
directly or indirectly the causes of poverty. Idleness paralyzes
efforts, which are the sinews of production. Ignorance and error
give our efforts a false direction. Improvidence lays us open to
deceptions. Indulgence in the appetites of the hour prevents the
accumulation of capital. Vanity leads us to devote our efforts to
factitious enjoyments, in place of such as are real. Violence and
<a id="p094" class="xxpn">[p094]</a> fraud provoke reprisals, oblige us to surround ourselves with
troublesome precautions, and entail a great waste and destruction
of power.</p>

<p>I shall wind up these preliminary observations on man with a
remark which I have already made in relation to his wants. It is
this, that the elements discussed and explained in this chapter, and
which enter into and constitute economical science, are in their
nature flexible and changeable. Wants, desires, materials and
powers furnished by Nature, our muscular force, our organs, our
intellectual faculties, our moral qualities, all vary with the individual,
and change with time and place. No two men, perhaps,
are entirely alike in any one of these respects, certainly not in
all—nay more, no man entirely resembles himself for two hours
together. What one knows another is ignorant of—what one
values another despises—here nature is prodigal, there niggardly—a
virtue which it is difficult to practise in one climate or latitude
becomes easy in another. Economical science has not, then, like
the exact sciences, the advantage of possessing a fixed measure,
and absolute unconditional truths—a graduated scale, a standard,
which can be employed in measuring the intensity of desires, of
efforts, and of satisfactions. Were we even to devote ourselves to
solitary labour, like certain animals, we should still find ourselves
placed in circumstances in some degree different; and were our
external circumstances alike, were the medium in which we act
the same for all, we should still differ from each other in our
desires, our wants, our ideas, our sagacity, our energy, our manner
of estimating and appreciating things, our foresight, our activity—so
that a great and inevitable inequality would manifest itself. In
truth, absolute isolation, the absence of all relations among men, is
only an idle fancy coined in the brain of Rousseau. But supposing
that this antisocial state, called the <em class="e000I2">state of nature</em>, had ever existed,
I cannot help inquiring by what chain of reasoning Rousseau and
his adepts have succeeded in planting Equality there? We shall
afterwards see that Equality, like Wealth, like Liberty, like Fraternity,
like Unity, is the end; it is not the starting point. It
rises out of the natural and regular development of societies. The
tendency of human nature is not away from, but towards, Equality.
This is most consoling and most true.</p>

<p>Having spoken of our <em class="e000I2">wants</em>, and our <em class="e000I2">means</em> of providing for
them, it remains to say a word respecting our <em class="e000I2">satisfactions</em>. They
are the result of the entire mechanism we have described.</p>

<p>It is by the greater or less amount of physical, intellectual, and
moral <em class="e000I2">satisfactions</em> which mankind enjoy, that we discover whether
<a id="p095" class="xxpn">[p095]</a> the machine works well or ill. This is the reason why the word
<em class="e000I2">consommation</em> [<em class="e000I2">consumption</em><a
href="#FN_24" id="FNa_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>], adopted by our Economists would
have a profound meaning if we used it in its etymological signification
as synonymous with <em class="e000I2">end</em>, or <em class="e000I2">completion</em>. Unfortunately, in
common, and even in scientific, language, it presents to the mind
a gross and material idea, exact without doubt when applied to
our physical wants, but not at all so when used with reference to
those of a more elevated order. The cultivation of corn, the manufacture
of woollen cloth, terminate in <em class="e000I2">consumption</em> [consommation].
But can this be said with equal propriety of the works of the artist,
the songs of the poet, the studies of the lawyer, the prelections of
the professor, the sermons of the clergyman? It is here that we
again experience the inconvenience of that fundamental error which
caused Adam Smith to circumscribe Political Economy within the
limits of a material circle; and the reader will pardon me for frequently
making use of the term <em class="e000I2">satisfaction</em>, as applicable to all our
wants and all our desires, and as more in accordance with the larger
scope which I hope to be able to give to the science.</p>

<p>Political Economists have been frequently reproached with confining
their attention exclusively to the <em class="e000I2">interests of the consumer</em>.
“You forget the producer,” we are told. But satisfaction being
the end and design of all our efforts—the grand <em class="e000I2">consummation</em> or
termination of the economic phenomena—is it not evident that it
is there that the touchstone of progress is to be found? A man’s
happiness and well-being are not measured by his <em class="e000I2">efforts</em>, but by his
<em class="e000I2">satisfactions</em>, and this holds equally true of society in the aggregate.
This is one of those truths which are never disputed when applied
to an individual, but which are constantly disputed when applied
to society at large. The phrase to which exception has been
taken only means this, that Political Economy estimates the
worth of what we do, not by the labour which it costs us to
do it, but by the ultimate result, which resolves itself definitively
into an increase or diminution of the general prosperity.</p>

<p>We have said, in reference to our wants and desires, that there
are no two men exactly alike. The same thing may be said of our
<em class="e000I2">satisfactions</em>: they are not held in equal estimation by all, which
verifies the common saying, that <em class="e000I2">tastes differ</em>. Now it is by the
intensity of our desires, and the variety of our tastes, that the
direction of our efforts is determined. It is here that the influence
of morals upon industry becomes apparent. Man, as an individual,
may be the slave of tastes which are factitious, puerile, and <a id="p096" class="xxpn">[p096]</a>
immoral.
In this case it is self-evident that, his powers being
limited, he can only satisfy his depraved desires at the expense
of those which are laudable and legitimate. But when society
comes into play, this evident axiom is marked down as an error.
We are led to believe that artificial tastes, illusory satisfactions,
which we acknowledge as the source of individual poverty, are
nevertheless the cause of national wealth, as opening a vent to
manufactures. If it were so, we should arrive at the miserable
conclusion, that the social state places man between poverty and
vice. Once more, Political Economy reconciles, in the most rigorous
and satisfactory manner, these apparent contradictions. <a id="p097" class="xxpn">[p097]</a></p>

<h2 title="IV. Exchange"><a id="IV"></a>IV.<br />
EXCHANGE.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
Exchange is Political Economy—it is Society itself—for it is
impossible to conceive Society as existing without Exchange, or
Exchange without Society. I shall not pretend in this chapter
to exhaust so vast a subject. To present even an outline of it
would require the entire volume.</p>

<p>If men, like snails, lived in complete isolation, if they did not
exchange their ideas and exertions, and had no bargain or transactions
with each other, we might have multitudes, indeed—human
units—individuals living in juxtaposition—but we could not have
<em class="e000I2">Society</em>.</p>

<p>Nay, we should not even have individuals. To man isolation is
death. But then, if he cannot live out of society, the legitimate
conclusion is that the social state is his natural state.</p>

<p>All the sciences tend to establish this truth, which was so little
understood by the men of the eighteenth century that they
founded morals and politics on the contrary assertion. They were
not content with placing the state of nature in opposition to the
social state—they gave the first a decided preference. “Men were
blessed,” said Montaigne, “when they lived without bonds, without
laws, without language, without religion.” And we know
that the system of Rousseau, which exercised, and still exercises,
so powerful an influence over opinions and facts, rests altogether
on this hypothesis—that men, unhappily, <em class="e000I2">agreed</em> one fine morning
to abandon the innocent <em class="e000I2">state of nature</em> for the stormy <em class="e000I2">state of
society</em>.</p>

<p>It is not the design of this chapter to bring together all possible
refutations of this fundamental error, the most fatal which has
ever infested the political sciences; for if society is the fruit of
invention and convention, it follows that every one may propose a
new model, and this, since Rousseau’s time, has in fact been the
<a id="p098" class="xxpn">[p098]</a> direction in which men’s minds have tended. I could easily demonstrate,
I believe, that isolation excludes language, as the
absence of language excludes thought; and man, deprived of
thought, instead of being a child of nature, ceases to be man
at all.</p>

<p>But a peremptory refutation of the idea upon which Rousseau’s
doctrine reposes, flows naturally from some considerations on Exchange.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Want</em>, <em class="e000I2">Effort</em>, <em class="e000I2">Satisfaction</em>,—such is man in an economical point
of view.</p>

<p>We have seen that the two extreme terms are essentially intransmissible,
for they terminate in sensation, they are sensation,
which is the most personal thing in the world, as well the
sensation which precedes the effort and determines it, as the sensation
which follows the effort and rewards it.</p>

<p>It is then the <em class="e000I2">Effort</em> which is exchanged; indeed, it cannot be
otherwise, since exchange implies action, and Effort alone manifests
the principle of activity. We cannot suffer or enjoy for one
another, unless we could experience personally the pains and
pleasures of others. But we can assist each other, work for one
another, render reciprocal <em class="e000I2">services</em>, and place our faculties, or the
results of their exercise, at the disposal of others, in consideration
of a return. This is society. The causes, the effects, the laws,
of these exchanges constitute the subject of political and social
economy.</p>

<p>We not only can exchange efforts and render reciprocal services,
but we do so necessarily. What I affirm is this, that our
organization is such that we are obliged to work for one another
under pain of death, of instant death. If it be so, society is our
state of nature, since it is the only state in which we can live at
all.</p>

<p>There is one observation which I have to make upon the equilibrium
between our wants and our faculties, an observation which
has always led me to admire the providential plan which regulates
our destinies:—</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">In the state of isolation our wants exceed our powers;</em></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">In the social state our powers exceed our wants.</em></p>

<p>Hence it follows that man in an isolated state cannot subsist,
whilst in the social state his most imperious wants give place to
desires of a higher order, and continue to do so in an ascending
career of progress and improvement to which it is impossible to
set limits.</p>

<p>This is not declamation, but an assertion capable of being <a id="p099" class="xxpn">[p099]</a>
rigorously
demonstrated by reasoning and analogy, if not by experience.
And why can it not be demonstrated by experience, by
direct observation? Precisely because it is true—precisely because,
man not being able to exist in a state of isolation, it becomes
impossible to exhibit in actual nature the effects of absolute solitude.
You cannot lay hold of a nonentity. You can prove to
me that a triangle never has four sides, but you cannot, in support
of your demonstration, place before my eyes a tetragonal triangle.
If you could, the exhibition of such a triangle would disprove
your assertion. In the same way, to ask me for experimental
proof, to ask me to study the effects of isolation in actual nature,
is to palm a contradiction upon me; for life and isolation being
incompatible, we have never seen, and never shall see, men without
social relations.</p>

<p>If there are animals (of which I am ignorant) destined by their
organization to make the round of their existence in absolute
isolation, it is very clear that nature must exactly proportion their
wants and their powers. It is possible to conceive that their
powers have the superiority, in which case these animals would be
progressive and capable of improvement. An equilibrium of wants
and powers would render them stationary beings; but the superiority
of their wants to their powers it is impossible to conceive.
From their birth, from their first appearance in life, their faculties
must be complete—relatively to the wants for which they have to
provide, or at least both must be developed in just proportion.
Otherwise the species would die the moment they came into
existence, and, consequently, could not be the subject of our observation.</p>

<p>Of all the species of living beings which surround us, undoubtedly
none have so many wants as man. In none is infancy so
long, so feeble, and so helpless—in none is maturity loaded with
so much responsibility—in none is old age so frail and so liable
to suffering. And, as if we had not enough of wants, man has
tastes also, the satisfaction of which exercises his faculties quite
as much as his wants. Scarcely has he appeased his hunger than
he begins to pamper himself with dainties—no sooner has he clothed
himself than he sighs for finery—no sooner has he obtained shelter
than he proceeds to embellish and decorate his residence. His
mind is as restless as his body is exacting. He seeks to fathom
the secrets of nature, to tame animals, to control the elements, to
dive into the bowels of the earth, to traverse broad seas, to soar
above the clouds, to annihilate time and space. He desires to
know the motions, the springs, the laws, of his mind and heart—to
<a id="p100" class="xxpn">[p100]</a> control his passions—to conquer immortality—to become a god—to
bring all things into subjection; nature, his fellow-men, himself.
In a word, his desires and aspirations expand continually,
and tend towards the infinite.</p>

<p>Thus, in no other species are the faculties so susceptible of vast
development as in man. It is his alone to compare and to judge,
to reason and to speak, to foresee, to sacrifice the present to the
future. He alone can transmit, from generation to generation, his
works, his thoughts, the treasures of his experience. He alone is
capable of a perfectibility which is indefinite, which forms a chain
the countless links of which would seem to stretch beyond the
limits of the present world.</p>

<p>Let me here set down an observation which belongs properly to
Political Economy. However extended may be the domain of
our faculties, they do not reach the length of <em class="e000I2">creating</em> anything.
Man cannot, in truth, augment or diminish the number of existing
particles of matter. His action is limited to subjecting the substances
which he finds around him to modifications and combinations
which fit them for his use.<a
href="#FN_25" id="FNa_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>To modify substances, so as to increase their utility in relation
to us, is to <em class="e000I2">produce</em>, or rather it is one mode of producing. From
this I conclude that value (as we shall afterwards more fully
explain) does not reside in these substances themselves, but in the
effort which intervenes in order to modify them, and which
exchange brings into comparison with other analogous efforts. This
is the reason why value is simply the appreciation of services
exchanged, whether a material commodity does or does not intervene.
As regards the notion of value, it is a matter of perfect
indifference whether I render to another a direct service, as, for
example, in performing for him a surgical operation, or an indirect
service, in preparing for him a curative substance. In this last
case the <em class="e000I2">utility</em> is in the substance, but the <em class="e000I2">value</em> is in the service,
in the effort, intellectual and muscular, made by one man for the
benefit of another. It is by a pure metonymy that we attribute
value to the material substance itself, and here, as on many other
occasions, metaphor leads science astray.</p>

<p>I return to the subject of man’s organization. If we adhere to
the preceding notions, he differs from other animals only in the
greater extent of his wants, and the superiority of his powers.
All, in fact, are subject to the one and provided with the other.
A bird undertakes long journeys in search of the temperature
which suits it best—the beaver crosses the river on a bridge of
<a id="p101" class="xxpn">[p101]</a> his own construction—the hawk pursues his prey openly—the cat
watches for it with patience—the spider prepares a snare—all
labour in order to live and multiply.</p>

<p>But while Nature has established an exact proportion between
the wants of animals and their faculties, if she has treated man
with greater bounty and munificence, if, in order to force him to
be <em class="e000I2">sociable</em>, she has decreed that in a state of isolation his wants
should surpass his faculties, whilst, on the contrary, in the social
state, his powers, superior to his wants, open to him an unlimited
field for nobler enjoyments, we ought to acknowledge that, as in
his relation with the Creator man is elevated above the beasts by
the religious sentiment, in his relations with his fellow-creatures
by his sense of justice, in his relations with himself by the moral
principle—in like manner, in relation to the means of living and
multiplying, he is distinguished by a remarkable phenomenon,
namely, <em class="e00S02">Exchange</em>.</p>

<p>Shall I essay to paint the state of poverty, of destitution, and of
ignorance, in which, but for the power of exchanging, the human
species would have been sunk, had it not, indeed, as is more
likely, disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>One of the most popular philosophers, in a romance which has
been the charm of the young from generation to generation, has
shown us man surmounting by his energy, his activity, his intelligence,
the difficulties of absolute solitude. For the purpose of
setting clearly before us what are the resources of that noble
creature, the author has exhibited him as accidentally cut off from
civilisation. It was part of Defoe’s plan to throw Robinson Crusoe
into the Island of Juan Fernandez alone, naked, deprived of all
that the union of efforts, the division of employments, exchange,
society, add to the human powers.</p>

<p>And yet, although the fancied obstacles are but imaginary,
Defoe would have taken away from his tale even the shadow of
probability if, too faithful to the thought which he wished to
develop, he had not made forced concessions to the social state, by
admitting that his hero had saved from shipwreck some indispensable
things, such as provisions, gunpowder, a gun, a hatchet, a
knife, cords, planks, iron, etc.; a decisive proof that society is the
necessary medium in which man lives, and out of which not even
a romance writer could figure him as existing.</p>

<p>And, observe, that Robinson Crusoe carried with him into
solitude another <em class="e000I2">social</em> treasure, a thousand times more precious
than all these, and which the waves could not engulf, I mean his
ideas, his recollections, his experience, above all, his language,
<a id="p102" class="xxpn">[p102]</a> without which he would not have been able to hold converse with
himself, that is to say, to think.</p>

<p>We have the unfortunate and unreasonable habit of attributing
to the <em class="e000I2">social state</em> the sufferings which we see around us. We are
right so far, if our object be to compare society with itself in
different degrees of advancement and improvement; but we are
wrong if our object be to compare the social state, however imperfect,
with a state of isolation. To authorize us to assert that
society impairs the condition, I do not say of man in general, but
of some men, and these the poorest and most wretched of the
species, we must begin by proving that the worst provided of our
fellow-creatures have to support in the social state a heavier load
of privations and sufferings than the man whose lot has been cast
in solitude. Now, examine the life of the humblest day-labourer.
Pass in review, in all their details, the articles of his daily consumption.
He is covered with some coarse clothing, he eats a
little common bread, he sleeps under shelter, and on boards, at
least, if he has no better couch. Now, let us ask if man in a state
of isolation, deprived of the resources of Exchange, could by any
possibility procure for himself that coarse clothing, that common
bread, that rude bed, that humble shelter? Rousseau himself, the
passionate enthusiast of the <em class="e000I2">state of nature</em>, avows the utter impossibility
of it. Men dispensed with everything, he says; they
went naked, they slept in the open air. Thus Rousseau, to exalt
the state of nature, was led to make happiness consist in privation.
And yet I affirm that this negative happiness is a chimera, and
that man in a state of isolation would infallibly perish in a very
few hours. Perhaps Rousseau would have gone to the length of
saying that that would have been the perfection of his system;
and he would have been consistent, for if privation be happiness,
death is perfection.</p>

<p>I trust the reader will not conclude from what precedes that we
are insensible to the social sufferings of our fellow-men. Because
these sufferings are less even in an imperfect state of society than
in a state of isolation, it does not follow that we should not invoke,
with all earnestness, that progress which constantly diminishes
them. But if isolation is something worse than all that is bad in
the social state, then I am justified in saying that it places our
wants, even the most imperious, far above our faculties and our
means of providing for wants.</p>

<p>In what way does Exchange advantageously reverse all this, and
place our faculties above our wants?</p>

<p>And first this is proved by the very fact of civilisation. If our
<a id="p103" class="xxpn">[p103]</a> wants surpassed our faculties, we should be beings invincibly retrograde;
if there were an equilibrium between them, we should be
invincibly stationary. But we advance; which shows that at
every stage of social life, as compared with the period that preceded
it, a certain portion of our powers, relatively to a given
amount of satisfactions, is left disposable. We shall endeavour
to explain this marvellous phenomenon.</p>

<p>The explanation which Condillac has given appears to me to
be quite unsatisfactory and empirical—in fact, it explains nothing.
“From the very fact,” he says, “that an exchange is made, it
follows that there must be profit for the two contracting parties,
for otherwise it would not take place. Then each exchange includes
two gains for humanity.”</p>

<p>Holding this proposition as true, we see in it only the statement
of a result. It is in this way that the <em class="e000I2">Malade Imaginaire</em> explains
the narcotic virtue of opium:—</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p>Quia est in eo</p>
<p>Virtus dormitiva</p>
<p>Quæ facit dormire.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Exchange includes two gains, you say. How? Why? It
results from the fact that it takes place. But why does it take
place? What motive has induced the contracting parties to effect
the exchange? Has Exchange in itself a mysterious virtue, necessarily
beneficial, and incapable of explanation?</p>

<p>Others make the advantage consist in this, that the one gives
away a commodity of which he has too much in order to receive
another of which he has too little. Exchange, they say, is a
<em class="e000I2">barter of the superfluous for the necessary</em>. This is contradicted
by facts which pass under our own eyes; for who can say that the
peasant, in giving away the corn which he has raised, but which
he is never to eat, gives away a superfluity? I see in this axiom
very clearly how two men may make an accidental arrangement,
but I see no explanation of progress.</p>

<p>Observation gives us a more satisfactory explanation of the
power of Exchange.</p>

<p>Exchange has two manifestations—namely, union of forces, and
separation of occupations.</p>

<p>It is very clear that in many cases the united force of several
men is superior, all things considered, to the sum of their individual
forces. Suppose that what is wanted is to remove a heavy load.
Where a thousand men in succession may fail, it is possible that
four men may succeed by uniting their efforts. Just let us reflect
how few things were ever accomplished in this world without union! <a id="p104" class="xxpn">[p104]</a></p>

<p>And yet this is only the concurrence of muscular forces in a
common design. Nature has endued us with very varied physical,
intellectual, and moral faculties. There are in the co-operation of
these faculties endless combinations. Is it wished to accomplish a
useful work, like the construction of a road, or the defence of a
country? One gives the community the benefit of his strength,
another of his agility, another of his courage, another of his experience,
foresight, imagination, even of his reputation. It is easy
to comprehend that the same men acting singly could not have
attained, or even conceived, the same results.</p>

<p>Now, union of forces implies Exchange. To induce men to co-operate,
they have the prospect of participating in the benefit to
be obtained. Each makes the other profit by his Efforts, and he
profits by the other’s Efforts in return, which is Exchange.</p>

<p>We see how Exchange in this way augments our Satisfactions.
The benefit consists in this, that efforts of equal intensity tend, by
the mere fact of their union, to superior results. There is here no
trace of the pretended <em class="e000I2">barter of the superfluous for the necessary</em>,
any more than of the double and empirical profit alleged by
Condillac.</p>

<p>The same remark applies to division of labour. Indeed, if we
regard the matter more closely, we shall be convinced that the
separation of employments is only another and more permanent
manner of uniting our forces—of co-operating, of <em class="e000I2">associating</em>; and
it is quite correct to say, as we shall afterwards demonstrate, that
the present social organization, provided Exchange is left free and
unfettered, is itself a vast and beautiful association—a marvellous
association, very different, indeed, from that dreamt of by the
Socialists, since, by an admirable mechanism, it is in perfect
accordance with individual independence. Every one can enter
and leave it at any moment which suits his convenience. He
contributes to it voluntarily, and reaps a satisfaction superior to
his contribution, and always increasing—a satisfaction determined
by the laws of justice and the nature of things, not by the arbitrary
will of a chief. But this is anticipating. All we have to do
at present is to explain how the division of labour increases our
power.</p>

<p>Without dwelling much on this subject, as it is one of the few
which do not give rise to controversy, a remark or two may not
be out of place. Its importance has perhaps been somewhat disparaged.
In order to demonstrate the powerful effects of the
Division of Labour, it has been usual to describe its marvellous
results in certain manufactures—in the making of pins, for
<a id="p105" class="xxpn">[p105]</a> example. But the subject admits of being viewed in a more
general and philosophical light. The force of habit has the
singular effect of concealing from us, and rendering us unconscious
of, the phenomena in the midst of which we live and move. No
saying is more profoundly true than that of Rousseau, “Much
philosophy is needed for the observation of what we see every
day.” It may not then be without use to recall what we owe to
Exchange, without perceiving it.</p>

<p>In what way has the power of exchanging elevated mankind to
the height of civilisation we have now attained? I answer, by
the influence which it exerts on <em class="e000I2">Labour</em>, upon the co-operation of
<em class="e000I2">natural agents</em>, upon the <em class="e000I2">powers and faculties</em> of man, and upon
<em class="e000I2">Capital</em>.</p>

<p>Adam Smith has clearly demonstrated its influence on Labour.</p>

<p>“The great increase in the quantity of work, which, in consequence
of the division of labour, the same number of people are
capable of performing, is owing to three circumstances,” says that
celebrated Economist: “<em class="e000I2">First</em>, to the increase of dexterity in
every particular workman; <em class="e000I2">secondly</em>, to the saving of time which
is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another;
<em class="e000I2">thirdly</em>, to this, that men are much more likely to discover easier
and readier methods of attaining an object when the whole attention
of their minds is directed to that single object, than when it
is dissipated among a great variety of things.”</p>

<p>Those who, like Adam Smith, see in Labour the exclusive
source of wealth, confine themselves to inquiring in what way
the division of labour increases its efficiency. But we have seen
in the preceding chapter that labour is not the sole agent in procuring
us satisfaction. <em class="e000I2">Natural forces</em> co-operate. That is beyond
doubt.</p>

<p>Thus, in agriculture, the action of the sun and of the rain, the
moisture of the earth, and the gases diffused in the atmosphere,
are undoubtedly agents which co-operate with human labour in
the production of vegetable substances.</p>

<p>Manufacturing industry owes analogous services to the chemical
qualities of certain substances, to water-power, to the elasticity of
steam, to gravitation, to electricity.</p>

<p>Commerce has turned to the profit of man the vigour and instincts
of certain races of animals, the force of the winds which fill the
sails of his ships, the laws of magnetism, which, acting on the
compass, direct the course of these ships through the pathless
ocean.</p>

<p>There are two verities which are beyond all dispute. The
<a id="p106" class="xxpn">[p106]</a> first is, that <em class="e000I2">the more man avails himself of the forces of nature, the
better he is provided with everything he requires</em>.</p>

<p>It is sufficiently evident that, with equal exertion, we obtain more
corn from a rich loamy soil than from sterile rocks or arid sands.</p>

<p>The second is, <em class="e000I2">that natural agents are unequally diffused over the
various countries of the world</em>.</p>

<p>Who would venture to maintain that all soils are equally well
fitted for all kinds of culture, or all countries for the same description
of manufactures?</p>

<p>Now, if it be true on the one hand that natural forces are unequally
diffused in the different countries of the world, and on the
other that men are richer in proportion as they avail themselves of
them, it follows that the faculty of Exchange immeasurably augments
the useful co-operation of these forces.</p>

<p>And here we recur once more to gratuitous and onerous utility,
the former being substituted for the latter by virtue of Exchange.
Is it not very clear, that if men were deprived of the
power of Exchange, and were obliged to produce ice under the
equator, and sugar at the poles, they must spend much pains in
doing what heat and cold do gratuitously, and that for them an
immense proportion of the Forces of nature would remain inoperative?
Thanks to Exchange, these forces are rendered useful to
us wherever we encounter them. Corn land is sown with wheat—in
wine-growing countries the land is planted with vines—there
are fishermen on the coasts, and wood-cutters among the mountains.
In one place a wheel which does the work of ten men is set in
motion by water—in another, by wind. Nature becomes a slave,
whom we have neither to feed, nor to clothe, nor to pay—who
costs nothing either to our purse or our conscience.<a
href="#FN_26" id="FNa_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> The same
amount of human efforts, that is to say, the same services, the
same value, realizes a constantly increasing amount of utility. For
each given result a certain portion only of human exertion is
absorbed; the remainder, by means of the intervention of natural
Forces, is rendered disposable, and it sets to work to overcome new
obstacles, to minister to new desires, to realize new utilities.</p>

<p>The effects of Exchange upon our intellectual Faculties are so
great, that we can scarcely even imagine their extent.</p>

<p>“Knowledge,” says M. de Tracy, “is the most precious of all
our acquisition, since it directs and governs the employment of
our forces, and renders them more prolific, in proportion as it is
sounder and more extensive. No man can himself observe <a id="p107" class="xxpn">[p107]</a> everything,
and it is much easier to learn than to invent. But when
several men communicate with each other, what is observed by
one is soon known to the rest; and if there be among them but
one person of superior ingenuity, precious discoveries speedily
become the property of all. In such circumstances, knowledge is
much more rapidly increased than it could be in a state of isolation,
without taking into account the power of preserving it, and
consequently of accumulating it from one generation to another.”</p>

<p>If the resources which nature has accumulated around man and
placed at his disposal are varied, the human faculties themselves
are not less so. We are not all equally endowed with strength,
courage, intelligence, patience, or with artistic, literary, and
industrial aptitudes. Without exchange, this diversity, far from
contributing to our well-being, would contribute to our misery,
each feeling less the advantage of those Faculties he possessed than
the deprivation of those he wanted. Thanks to exchange, a man
possessed of bodily strength may, up to a certain point, dispense
with genius, and a man of intelligence with bodily strength; for
by the admirable community which the power of exchange
establishes among men, each individual participates in the distinctive
qualities of his neighbours.</p>

<p>In order to obtain the satisfactions he desires, it is not enough,
in most cases, to work—to exercise his faculties upon, or by means
of, natural agents. He requires also to have tools, instruments,
machines, provisions—in a word, Capital. Suppose a small tribe,
composed of ten families, each, in working exclusively for itself,
being obliged to engage in ten different employments. In that
case each family must have ten sets of industrial apparatus. The
tribe would require to possess ten ploughs, ten teams of oxen, ten
forges, ten joiner’s and carpenter’s workshops, ten looms, etc.;
while, with the power of exchange, a single plough, a single team,
a single forge, a single loom, would be sufficient. It is impossible
to conceive the economy of Capital which we owe to exchange.</p>

<p>The reader now sees clearly what constitutes the true power of
exchange. It is not, as Condillac says, that it implies <em class="e000I2">two gains</em>,
because of each of the contracting parties valuing more highly
what he receives than what he gives. Neither is it that each
gives away what is superfluous for what is necessary. It lies
simply in this, that when one man says to another, “Do you
only this, and I shall do only that, and we shall divide,” there is
a better and more advantageous employment of labour, of faculties,
of natural agents, of capital, and consequently there is <em class="e000I2">more</em> to
divide. And these results take place to a still greater extent when
<a id="p108" class="xxpn">[p108]</a> three, ten, a hundred, a thousand, or several millions of men enter
into the association.</p>

<p>The two propositions which I have laid down, then, are rigorously
true, viz.:—</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">In isolation our wants exceed our powers;</em></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">In society our powers exceed our wants.</em></p>

<p>The first is true, seeing that the whole surface of our country
would not maintain one man in a state of absolute isolation.</p>

<p>The second is true, seeing that, in fact, the population which
is spread over that same surface multiplies and grows richer.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Progress of Exchange.</em>—The primitive form of exchange is
<em class="e000I2">Barter</em>. Two persons, one of whom desires an object, and is
possessed of an object which the other desires, agree to cede these
objects reciprocally, or they agree to work separately, each at one
thing, but for the purpose of dividing the total product of their
labour in arranged proportions. This is <em class="e000I2">Barter</em>, which is, as the
Socialists would say, Exchange, traffic, commerce <em class="e000I2">in embryo</em>.
We observe here two Desires as motives—two Efforts as means—two
Satisfactions as results, or as the termination and completion
of the entire cycle; and this evolution is not essentially different
from the same evolution accomplished in a state of isolation, except
that the desires and satisfactions have, as their nature requires,
remained intransmissible, and that Efforts alone have been
exchanged. In other words, the two persons have worked for
each other, and have rendered each other reciprocal <em class="e000I2">services</em>.</p>

<p>It is at this point that Political Economy truly begins, for it is
here that <em class="e000I2">value</em> first makes its appearance. Barter takes place
only after an arrangement, a discussion. Each of the contracting
parties is governed by considerations of self-interest. Each of
them makes a calculation, which in effect comes to this, “I shall
barter if the barter procures me the <em class="e000I2">satisfaction</em> I <em class="e000I2">desire</em> with a less
<em class="e000I2">Effort</em>.” It is certainly a marvellous phenomenon that diminished
efforts can yet keep pace with undiminished desires and satisfactions;
and this is explained by the considerations which I have
presented in the first part of this chapter. When two commodities
or two services are <em class="e000I2">bartered</em>, we may conclude that they are of
<em class="e000I2">equal value</em>. We shall have to analyze afterwards the notion of
<em class="e000I2">value</em>, but this vague definition is sufficient for the present.</p>

<p>We may suppose a <em class="e000I2">round-about barter</em>, including three contracting
parties. <em class="e000I2">Paul</em> renders a service to <em class="e000I2">Peter</em>, who renders an
equivalent service to <em class="e000I2">James</em>, who in turn renders an equivalent
service to <em class="e000I2">Paul</em>, by means of which all is balanced. I need not
say that this round-about transaction only takes place because it
<a id="p109" class="xxpn">[p109]</a> suits all the parties, without changing either the nature or the
consequences of barter.</p>

<p>The essence of Barter is discovered in all its purity even when
the number of contracting parties is greater. In my <em class="e000I2">commune</em>
the vine-dresser pays with wine for the services of the blacksmith,
the barber, the tailor, the beadle, the curate, the grocer; while the
blacksmith, the barber, the tailor, in turn deliver to the grocer,
for the commodities consumed during the year, the wine which
they have received from the vine-dresser.</p>

<p>This round-about Barter, I cannot too often repeat, does not
change in the least degree the primary notions explained in the
preceding chapters. When the evolution is complete, each of
those who have had part in it presents still the triple phenomenon,
<em class="e000I2">want</em>, <em class="e000I2">effort</em>, <em class="e000I2">satisfaction</em>. We have but to add, the exchange of
efforts, the transmission of services, the separation of employments,
with all their resulting advantages—advantages to which
every one of the parties has contributed, seeing that isolated
individual labour is a <em class="e000I2">pis aller</em>, always reserved, and which is
only renounced in consideration of a certain advantage.</p>

<p>It is easy to comprehend that Barter in kind, especially the
indirect and round-about barter which I have described, cannot
be much extended, and it is unnecessary to dwell upon the
obstacles which set limits to it. How could he manage, for
example, who wished to exchange his house against the thousand
articles which enter into his annual consumption? In any case,
Barter could never take place but among the few persons who
happen to be acquainted with each other. Progress and the
Division of Labour would soon reach their limits if mankind had
not discovered the means of facilitating exchanges.</p>

<p>This is the reason why men, from the earliest ages of society,
have employed an intermediate commodity to effect their transactions—corn,
wine, animals, and almost always, the precious
metals. Such commodities perform this function of facilitating
exchanges more or less conveniently; still any one of them can
perform it, provided that, in the transaction, Effort is represented
by <em class="e000I2">value</em>, the transmission of which is the thing to be
effected.</p>

<p>When recourse is had to an intermediate commodity, two
economic phenomena make their appearance, which we denominate
<em class="e000I2">Sale</em> and <em class="e000I2">Purchase</em>. It is evident that the idea of <em class="e000I2">sale</em>
and <em class="e000I2">purchase</em> is not included in direct Barter, or even in round-about
Barter. When a man gives another something to drink, in
consideration of receiving from him something to eat, we have a
<a id="p110" class="xxpn">[p110]</a> simple fact which we cannot analyze farther. Now, what we
must remark in the very outset of the science is, that exchanges
which are effected by means of an intermediate commodity do not
lose the nature, the essence, the quality of barter—only the
barter is no longer simple, but compound. To borrow the very
judicious and profound observation of J. B. Say, it is a barter of
<em class="e000I2">two factors</em> [troc à deux facteurs], of which the one is called <em class="e000I2">sale</em>
and the other <em class="e000I2">purchase</em>—factors whose union is indispensable in
order to constitute a complete barter.</p>

<p>In truth, this discovery of a convenient means of effecting
exchanges makes no alteration in the nature either of men or
of things. We have still in every case the <em class="e000I2">want</em> which determines
the <em class="e000I2">effort</em>, and the <em class="e000I2">satisfaction</em> which rewards it. The Exchange
is complete only when the man who has made an <em class="e000I2">effort</em> in favour
of another has obtained from him an equivalent service, that is to
say, <em class="e000I2">satisfaction</em>. To effect this, he <em class="e000I2">sells</em> his service for the intermediate
commodity, and then with that intermediate commodity
he <em class="e000I2">purchases</em> equivalent services, when the two factors bring back
the transaction to simple <em class="e000I2">barter</em>.</p>

<p>Take the case of a physician, for instance. For many years he
has devoted his time and his faculties to the study of diseases and
their remedies. He has visited patients, he has prescribed for
them, in a word, he has rendered <em class="e000I2">services</em>. Instead of receiving
compensation from his patients in <em class="e000I2">direct services</em>, which would
have constituted simple barter, he receives from them an intermediate
commodity, the precious metals, wherewith he purchases
the satisfactions which were the ultimate object he had in view.
His patients have not furnished him with bread, wine, or other
goods, but they have furnished him with the value of these.
They could not have given him money unless they had themselves
rendered <em class="e000I2">services</em>. As far as they are concerned, therefore,
there is a balance of <em class="e000I2">services</em>, and there is also a balance as regards
the physician; and could we in thought follow this circulation
of services out and out, we should see that Exchange carried
on by the intervention of money resolves itself into a multitude of
acts of simple barter.</p>

<p>In the case of simple barter, <em class="e000I2">value</em> is the appreciation of two
services exchanged and directly compared with each other. In
the case of <em class="e000I2">Compound Exchange</em> the two services measure each
other’s value, not directly, but by comparison with this mean
term, this intermediate commodity, which is called Money. We
shall see by-and-by what difficulties, what errors, have sprung
from this complication. At present it is sufficient to remark that
<a id="p111" class="xxpn">[p111]</a> the intervention of this intermediate commodity makes no change
whatever in the notion of <em class="e000I2">value</em>.</p>

<p>Only admit that exchange is at once the cause and the effect
of the division of labour and the separation of employments; only
admit that the separation of occupations multiplies <em class="e000I2">satisfactions</em> in
proportion to <em class="e000I2">efforts</em>, for the reasons explained at the beginning of
this chapter, and you will comprehend at once the services which
Money has rendered to mankind, by the simple fact that it facilitates
Exchanges. By means of Money, Exchange is indefinitely
extended and developed. Each man casts his services into the
common fund, without knowing who is to enjoy the satisfactions
which they are calculated to procure. In the same way he obtains
from society, not immediate services, but money with which
he can afterwards purchase services, where, when, and how it may
best suit him. In this way the ultimate transactions occur at
various times and places, between people totally unacquainted
with each other, and in the greater number of cases no one knows
by whose <em class="e000I2">efforts</em> his <em class="e000I2">wants</em> will be <em class="e000I2">satisfied</em>, or to the <em class="e000I2">satisfaction</em> of
whose <em class="e000I2">desires</em> his own <em class="e000I2">efforts</em> will contribute. Exchange, by the
intervention of Money, resolves itself into innumerable acts of
<em class="e000I2">barter</em>, of which the contracting parties themselves are ignorant.</p>

<p>Exchange, however, confers so great a benefit on society (is it
not society itself?) that it facilitates and extends it by other means
besides the introduction of money. In logical order, after Want
and Satisfaction united in the same individual with isolated Effort—after
simple barter—after barter <em class="e000I2">à deux facteurs</em>, or Exchange
composed of <em class="e000I2">sale</em> and <em class="e000I2">purchase</em>—come other transactions, extended
farther over time and space by means of credit, mortgages, bills of
exchange, bank notes, etc. By means of this wondrous machinery,
the result of civilisation, the improver of civilisation, and itself
becoming more perfect at the same time, an exertion made at the
present hour in Paris may contribute to the satisfaction and enjoyment
of an unknown stranger, separated from us by oceans and
centuries; and he who makes the exertion will not the less receive
for it a present recompense, through the intervention of persons
who advance the remuneration, and wait to be reimbursed in a
distant country or at a future day. Marvellous and astonishing
complication! which, when subjected to analysis, shows us finally
the accomplishment of the entire economic cycle—<em class="e000I2">want</em>, <em class="e000I2">effort</em>,
<em class="e000I2">satisfaction</em>, taking place in each individual, according to a just law.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Limits of Exchange.</em>—The general character of Exchange is
<em class="e000I2">to diminish the proportion which the Effort bears to the satisfaction</em>.
Between our wants and our satisfactions <em class="e000I2">obstacles</em> are interposed,
<a id="p112" class="xxpn">[p112]</a> which we succeed in diminishing by the union of forces or the
division of occupations, that is to say, by <em class="e000I2">Exchange</em>. But Exchange
itself encounters obstacles and demands efforts. The
proof of this is the immense amount of human labour which it
sets in motion. The precious metals, roads, canals, railways,
wheeled carriages, ships—all these things absorb a considerable
portion of human activity. Observe, besides, how many men are
exclusively occupied in facilitating exchanges—how many bankers,
merchants, shopkeepers, brokers, carriers, sailors! This vast and
costly apparatus shows us, better than any reasoning, how much
efficacy there is in the power of Exchange, for why otherwise
should society be encumbered with it?</p>

<p>Since it is the nature of Exchange to <em class="e000I2">save</em> efforts and to <em class="e000I2">exact</em>
them, it is easy to understand what are its natural limits. In
virtue of that motive which urges man to choose always the least
of two evils, Exchange will go on extending itself indefinitely as
long as the effort it exacts is less than the effort which it saves.
And its extension will stop naturally when, upon the whole,
the aggregate of satisfactions obtained by the division of labour
becomes less, by reason of the increasing difficulties attending
Exchange, than if we procured them by direct production.</p>

<p>Suppose the case of a small tribe. If they desire to procure
themselves satisfactions they must make an effort. They may
address themselves to another tribe, and say to them, “Make this
effort for us, and we shall make another for you.” The stipulation
may suit all parties, if, for example, the second tribe is in a
situation to obtain greater assistance than the other from natural
and gratuitous forces. In that case it may be able to realize the
result with an effort equal to eight, while the first could only accomplish
it by an effort equal to twelve. There is thus an
economy equal to four for the first. But then come the cost of
transport, the remuneration of intermediate agents, in a word, the
effort exacted by the machinery of Exchange. This cost must, then,
clearly be added to the figure eight. Exchange will continue to
take place as long as the Exchange <em class="e000I2">itself</em> does not cost four. The
moment it reaches that figure it will stop. It is quite unnecessary
to make laws on this subject; for either the law intervenes
before this level is attained, and then it is injurious—it prevents an
economy of efforts—or it comes after it, and then it is useless, like
an ordinance forbidding people to light their lamps at noonday.</p>

<p>When Exchange is thus arrested from ceasing to be advantageous,
the slightest improvement in the <em class="e000I2">commercial apparatus</em> gives
it a new activity. Between Orleans and Angoulême a certain
<a id="p113" class="xxpn">[p113]</a> number of transactions take place. These towns effect an Exchange
as often as they can obtain a greater amount of enjoyments
by that means than by direct production. They stop
short the moment the cost of obtaining commodities by means of
exchange, aggravated by the cost of effecting the exchange
itself, surpasses, or reaches, that of obtaining them by means of
direct production. In these circumstances, if we improve the
conditions under which Exchanges are effected—if the merchants’
profits are diminished, or the means of transport facilitated—if
roads and railways are made, mountains levelled, and bridges
thrown over rivers—in a word, if obstacles are removed, the
number of Exchanges will be increased; for men are always
desirous to avail themselves of the great advantages which we
have ascribed to Exchange, and to substitute gratuitous for
onerous utility. The improvement of the <em class="e000I2">commercial apparatus</em>,
then, is equivalent to bringing two cities locally nearer to each
other. Whence it follows that bringing men physically, locally,
nearer each other is equivalent to improving the conditions of
exchange. This is very important. It is, in fact, the solution of
the problem of population; and this is precisely the element in that
great problem that Malthus has neglected. Where Malthus saw
Discordance, attention to this element enables us to discover
<em class="e000I2">Harmony</em>.</p>

<p>When men effect an exchange, it is because they succeed by
that means in obtaining an equal amount of <em class="e000I2">satisfaction</em> at a less
expense of <em class="e000I2">effort</em>; and the reason of this is, that on both sides
services are rendered which are the means of procuring a greater
proportion of what we have termed <em class="e000I2">gratuitous utility</em>.</p>

<p>Now, you have always a greater number of exchanges in proportion
as you remove the <em class="e000I2">obstacles</em> which impede exchanges, and
diminish the <em class="e000I2">efforts</em> which these exchanges exact.</p>

<p>And Exchange encounters fewer obstacles, and exacts fewer
efforts, just in proportion as you bring men nearer each other, and
mass them more together. A greater density of population, then,
is accompanied by a greater proportion of <em class="e000I2">gratuitous utility</em>. That
density imparts greater power to the machinery of exchange; it
sets free and renders disposable a portion of human efforts; it is a
cause of progress.</p>

<p>Now, if you please, let us leave generalities and look at facts.</p>

<p>Does not a street of equal length render more service in Paris
than in a remote village? Is not a mile of railway of more use
in the Department of the Seine than in the Department of the
Landes? Is not a London merchant content with smaller profits
<a id="p114" class="xxpn">[p114]</a> on account of the greater amount of business which he transacts?
In everything we shall discover two sets of exchange agencies at
work, which although identical in kind, act very differently, according
as they operate in a densely or a thinly peopled locality.</p>

<p>The density of population not only enables us to reap more
advantage from the machinery of exchange, it permits us to improve
that machinery, and increase its power. Where the population
is condensed, these improvements are advantageous, because
they save us more efforts than they exact; but where the population
is scattered and thin-spread, they exact more efforts than
they save.</p>

<p>On leaving the metropolis for a time, and going to reside in a
small provincial town, one is astonished to find that in many
instances the most ordinary <em class="e000I2">services</em> can only be obtained at great
expense, and with time and difficulty.</p>

<p>It is not the material part of the commercial mechanism only
which is turned to account and improved by the single circumstance
of the density of population, but the moral part also.
When men are massed together, they have more facility in
dividing their employments, in uniting their powers, and in combining
to found churches and schools, to provide for their common
security, to establish banks and insurance companies, in a word,
to procure themselves all the common enjoyments with a much
smaller proportion of efforts.</p>

<p>We shall revert to these considerations when we come to enter
on the subject of Population. At present we shall make only
this remark:—</p>

<p>Exchange enables men to turn their faculties to better account,
to economize capital, to obtain more assistance from the gratuitous
agencies of nature, to increase the proportion of gratuitous to
onerous utility, to diminish, consequently, the ratio of efforts to
results, and to leave at their disposal a part of their forces, so that
they may withdraw a greater and greater portion of them from
the business of providing for their primary and more imperious
wants, and devote them to procuring enjoyments of a higher and
higher order.</p>

<p>If Exchange saves efforts, it also exacts them. It extends, and
spreads, and increases, up to the point at which the effort it
exacts becomes equal to the effort which it saves, and it stops
there until, by the improvement of the commercial apparatus, or
by the circumstance exclusively of the condensation of population,
and bringing men together in masses, it again returns to the conditions
which are essential to its onward and ascending march.
<a id="p115" class="xxpn">[p115]</a> Whence it follows that laws which limit or hamper Exchanges are
always either hurtful or superfluous.</p>

<p>Governments which persuade themselves that nothing good
can be done but through their instrumentality, refuse to acknowledge
this harmonic law.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Exchange develops itself</em> <em class="e0U003">NATURALLY</em> <em class="e000I2">until it becomes more onerous
than useful, and at that point it</em> <em class="e0U003">NATURALLY</em> <em class="e000I2">stops</em>.</p>

<p>In consequence, we find governments everywhere busying themselves
in favouring or restraining trade.</p>

<p>In order to carry it <em class="e000I2">beyond</em> its natural limits, they set to conquering
colonies and opening new markets. In order to confine
it <em class="e000I2">within</em> its natural bounds, they invent all sorts of restrictions
and fetters.</p>

<p>This intervention of Force in human transactions is the source of
innumerable evils.</p>

<p>The Increase of this force itself is an evil to begin with; for it
is very evident that the State cannot make conquests, retain distant
countries under its rule, or divert the natural course of trade by the
action of tariffs, without greatly increasing the number of its agents.</p>

<p>The Diversion of the public Force from its legitimate functions
is an evil still greater than its Increase. Its rational mission was
to protect Liberty and Property; and here you have it violating
Liberty and Property. All just notions and principles are thus
effaced from men’s minds. The moment you admit that Oppression
and Spoliation are legitimate, provided they are legal—provided
they interfere only by means of the Law or public Force,
you find by degrees each class of citizens demanding that the interest
of every other class should be sacrificed to it.</p>

<p>This intervention of Force in the business of Exchanges,
whether it succeeds in promoting or in restraining them, cannot
fail to occasion both the Loss and Displacement of labour and
capital, and, of consequence, a disturbance of the natural distribution
of the population. On one side, natural interests disappear,
on the other, artificial interests are created, and men are forced to
follow the course of these interests. It is thus we see important
branches of industry established where they ought not to be.
France makes sugar; England spins cotton, brought from the
plains of India. Centuries of war, torrents of blood, the dissipation
of vast treasures, have brought about these results, and the
effect has been to substitute in Europe sickly and precarious for
sound and healthy enterprises, and to open the door to commercial
crises, to stoppages, to instability, and finally to Pauperism.</p>

<p>But I find I am anticipating. What we ought first to do is to
<a id="p116" class="xxpn">[p116]</a> acquaint ourselves with the free and natural development of human
societies, and then investigate the Disturbances.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Moral Force of Exchange.</em>—We must repeat, at the risk of
wounding modern sentimentalism, that Political Economy belongs
to the region of <em class="e000I2">business</em>, and business is transacted under the
influence of <em class="e000I2">personal interest</em>. In vain the puritans of socialism
cry out, “This is frightful; we shall change all this.” Such declamations
involve a flat contradiction. Do we make purchases on
the Quai Voltaire in the name of Fraternity?</p>

<p>It would be to fall into another kind of declamation to attribute
morality to acts determined and governed by <em class="e000I2">self-interest</em>. But a
good and wise Providence may so have arranged the social order
that these very acts, destitute of morality in their motives, may
nevertheless tend to moral results. Is it not so in the case of
labour? Now, I maintain that Exchange, whether in the incipient
state of simple barter, or expanded into a vast and complicated
commerce, develops in society tendencies more noble than the
motive which gives rise to it.</p>

<p>I have certainly no wish to attribute to only one of our powers
all that constitutes the grandeur, the glory, and the charm of our
existence. As there are two forces in the material world—one
which goes from the circumference to the centre, the other from
the centre to the circumference—there are also two principles in
the social world, self-interest and sympathy. It were a misfortune
indeed did we fail to recognise the benefits and joys of the sympathetic
principle, as manifested in friendship, love, filial piety,
parental tenderness, charity, patriotism, religion, enthusiasm for
the good and the beautiful. Some have maintained that the sympathetic
principle is only a magnificent form of self-love, that to
love others is at bottom only an intelligent way of loving ourselves.
This is not the place to enter on the solution of that problem.
Whether these two native energies are distinct or confounded,
it is enough for us to know that, far from being antagonistic, as is
constantly said, they act in combination, and concur in the realization
of one and the same result, the general good.</p>

<p>I have established these two propositions:—</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">In a state of isolation, our wants exceed our powers;</em></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">In consequence of Exchange, our powers exceed our wants.</em></p>

<p>These propositions show the end and purpose of society. There
are two others which guarantee its indefinite improvement:—</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">In a state of isolation the gain of one may be the loss of another;</em></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">In consequence of Exchange, the gain of each is the gain of all.</em></p>

<p>Is it necessary to prove that, if nature had destined man to a
<a id="p117" class="xxpn">[p117]</a> solitary life, the prosperity of one would have been incompatible
with that of another, and the more numerous men had been, the
less chance would they have had of attaining prosperity? At all
events, we see clearly in what way numbers might have been
injurious, and we do not see how they could have been beneficial.
And then, I would ask, under what form could the principle of
sympathy have manifested itself? How, or on what occasion,
could it have been called forth? Could we have even comprehended
it?</p>

<p>But men exchange, and Exchange, as we have seen, implies the
separation of employments. It gives birth to professions and
trades. Each man sets himself to overcome a certain class of
obstacles, for the benefit of the Community. Each makes it his
business to render a certain description of <em class="e000I2">services</em>. Now, a complete
analysis of value demonstrates that each service <em class="e000I2">has value</em> in
the first instance in proportion to its intrinsic utility, and afterwards
in proportion to the wealth of those to whom it is furnished—that
is to say, in proportion as the community to whom the
service is rendered has a greater demand for it, and is in a better
situation to pay for it. Experience shows us that the artizan, the
physician, the lawyer, the merchant, the carrier, the professor, the
<em class="e000I2">savant</em>, derive greater returns from their services in Paris, in
London, or at New York, than in the Landes of Gascony, or the
mountains of Wales, or the prairies of the Far West. And does
not this confirm the truth, <em class="e000I2">that each man is more likely to prosper
in proportion to the general prosperity of the community in which he
lives</em>?</p>

<p>Of all the harmonies which have come under my observation,
this is beyond doubt the most important, the finest, the most
decisive, the most suggestive. It sums up and includes all the
others. This is why I can give only a very incomplete demonstration
of it in this place. The whole scope and spirit of this
work will establish it; and I shall deem it a fortunate thing if its
probability at least is made so apparent as to induce the reader
to convince himself of its truth by farther inquiry and reflection.</p>

<p>For it is beyond question that on this turns our decision between
natural and artificial Organizations—that on this, and this
alone, hangs the solution of the Social Problem. If the prosperity
of all be the condition of the prosperity of each, then we can repose
with confidence not only on the economic power of free
trade, but on its moral force. If men only understood their true
interests, restrictions, mercantile jealousies, commercial wars,
monopolies, would go down under the influence of public opinion;
<a id="p118" class="xxpn">[p118]</a> and before soliciting the interposition of government in any case,
the question would be, not “How am <em class="e000I2">I</em> to be benefited by it?”
but “What advantage is likely to result from it to the community?”
This last question, I grant, is sometimes elicited by the
principle of sympathy; but let men be once enlightened, and it
will be called forth by Self-interest. Then we shall be enabled to
say with truth that the two motive principles of our nature tend
towards the same result—the General Good; and it will be impossible
to deny Moral Power to self-interest, and the transactions
which spring from it, as far at least as their effects are concerned.</p>

<p>Consider the relations of man to man, family to family, province
to province, nation to nation, hemisphere to hemisphere,
capitalist to labourer, the man of property to the man of no property,—it
seems evident to me that it is impossible to resolve the
social problem from any one of these points of view, or even to
enter upon its solution, before choosing between these two
maxims:—</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">The profit of one is the loss of another;</em></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">The profit of one is the gain of another.</em></p>

<p>For if nature has arranged matters so that antagonism is the
law of free transactions, our only resource is to vanquish nature
and stifle Freedom. If, on the other hand, these free transactions
are harmonious, that is to say, if they tend to ameliorate and
equalize the conditions of men, our efforts must be confined to
allowing nature to act, and maintaining the rights of human
Liberty.</p>

<p>This is the reason why I conjure the young people to whom
this work is dedicated to scrutinize with care the formulas which
it lays down, and to analyze the peculiar nature and effects of
Exchange. I hope yet to find at least one among them who will
be able to demonstrate rigorously this proposition: “<em class="e000I2">The good of
each tends to the good of all, as the good of all tends to the good of
each</em>;” and who will, moreover, be able to impress this truth
upon men’s minds by rendering the proof of it simple, lucid, and
irrefragable. The man who does this will have resolved the
social problem, and be the benefactor of the human race.</p>

<p>Depend upon it, that according as this axiom is true or false,
the natural laws of society are harmonious or antagonistic; and
that according as they are harmonious or antagonistic, it is our
interest to conform to them or to deviate from them. Were it
once thoroughly demonstrated, then, that under the empire of
freedom men’s interests harmonize and favour each other, all the
efforts which we now see governments making to disturb the
<a id="p119" class="xxpn">[p119]</a> action of these natural social laws we should see directed to
giving them force, or rather, no efforts whatever would then be
necessary, and all they would have to do would be to abstain from
interfering. In what does the restraining action of governments
consist? We may infer it from the design they have in view.
What is that design? To remedy the inequality which is supposed
to spring from Liberty. Now, there is only one way of re-establishing
the equilibrium, namely, <em class="e000I2">to take from one in order to
give to another</em>. Such, in fact, is the mission which governments
have arrogated to themselves, or have received; and it is a
rigorous consequence of the formula, that <em class="e000I2">the gain of one is the loss
of another</em>. If that axiom be true, Force must repair the evils of
Liberty. Thus governments, instituted for the protection of
liberty and property, have undertaken the task of violating
liberty and property in every shape; and they have done so consistently,
if it be in liberty and property that the germ and principle
of evil reside. Hence we see them everywhere engaged in
the artificial displacement and redistribution of labour, capital,
and responsibility.</p>

<p>On the other hand, an incalculable amount of intellectual force
is thrown away in the pursuit of artificial social organizations.
<em class="e000I2">To take from one in order to give to another</em>, to violate both liberty
and property, is a very simple design, but the means of carrying
out that design may be varied to infinity. Hence arise multitudes
of systems, which strike the producing classes with terror, since
from the very nature of the object they have in view, they menace
all existing interests.</p>

<p>Thus arbitrary and complex systems of government, the negation
of liberty and property, the antagonism of classes and nations,
all these are logically included in the axiom, that <em class="e000I2">the gain of one is
the loss of another</em>. And, for the same reason, simplicity in government,
respect for individual dignity, freedom of labour and
exchange, peace among nations, security for person and property,
are all contained and shut up in this truth—Interests are harmonious.
They are so, however, only on one condition, which is,
that this truth should be generally admitted.</p>

<p>But it is very far from being so. On reading what I have said
on this subject many people will be led to say, You break through
an open door. Who ever thought of contesting seriously the
superiority of Exchange to Isolation? In what book, unless indeed
in the works of Rousseau, have you encountered this strange
paradox?</p>

<p>Those who stop me with this reflection forget only two things, two
<a id="p120" class="xxpn">[p120]</a> symptoms, or rather two aspects of modern society, the doctrines
with which theorists inundate us, and the practice which governments
impose on us. It is quite impossible that the harmony of
interests can be universally recognised, since, on the one hand,
public force is constantly engaged in interfering to disturb natural
combinations, while, on the other, the great complaint which is
made against the ruling power is, that it does not interfere enough.</p>

<p>The question is this, Are the evils (I do not speak here of evils
which arise from our native infirmity)—are the evils to which
society is subject imputable to the action of natural social laws, or
to our disturbance of that action?</p>

<p>Now, here we have two co-existent facts, Evil,—and Public
Force, engaged to counteract the natural social laws. Is the first
of these facts the consequence of the second? For my own part,
I believe so; I should even say, I am certain of it. But at the
same time I can attest this, that in proportion as evil is developed,
governments invariably seek for a remedy in new disturbances of
the natural laws, and theorists reproach them with not going far
enough. Am I not thence entitled to conclude that they have but
little confidence in these laws?</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, if the question is between Isolation and Exchange
we are at one. But if the question be between free and compulsory
exchange, does the same thing hold? Is there nothing
forced, factitious, restrained, constrained, in France, in the manner
in which services which have relation to trade, to credit, to conveyances,
to the arts, to education, to religion, are exchanged? Are
labour and capital distributed naturally between agriculture and
manufactures? When existing interests are disturbed, are they
allowed of their own accord to return to their natural channels?
Do we not encounter trammels and obstacles on all sides?
Are there not a hundred professions which are interdicted to the
majority of the people? Is the Roman-catholic not <em class="e000I2">forced</em> to pay
for the services of the Jewish Rabbi, and the Jew for the services
of the Catholic priest? Is there a single man in France who has
received the education which his parents would have given him
had they been free? Are not our minds, our manners, our ideas,
our employments, fashioned under the <em class="e000I2">régime</em> of the arbitrary, or
at least of the artificial? Now, I ask, whether thus to disturb
the free exchange of services is not to abjure and deny the harmony
of interests? On what ground am I robbed of my liberty,
unless it be that it is judged hurtful to others? Is it pretended
that it is injurious to myself? This would be but to add one
antagonism the more. And only think! in what a situation
<a id="p121" class="xxpn">[p121]</a> should we find ourselves if nature had placed in each man’s heart
a permanent irrepressible spring of action, urging him to injure
those around him, and at the same time to injure himself?</p>

<p>Alas! we have tried everything—when shall we make trial of
the simplest thing of all—Liberty. Liberty in all that does not
offend against justice—liberty to live, advance, improve—the free
exercise of our faculties—the free interchange of services. A
beautiful and solemn spectacle it would have been, had the Power
which sprang from the revolution of February thus addressed our
citizens:—</p>

<p>“You have invested me with the public Force. I shall apply
it exclusively to those things in which the intervention of Force
is permissible, and there is but one—Justice. I shall force every
one to confine himself within the bounds of right. You may work
freely and as you please during the day, and sleep in peace at
night. I have taken under my charge the security of person and
property—that is my mission, and I will fulfil it—<em class="e000I2">but I accept no
other</em>. Let there then be no longer any misunderstanding between
us. Henceforth you shall pay me only the light tribute which is
necessary for the maintenance of order and the administration of
justice. Keep in mind that henceforth every man must depend
upon himself for his subsistence and advancement. Turn no
longer your longing eyes to me. Ask me no longer for wealth,
for employment, for credit, for education, for religion, for morality.
Never forget that the mainspring of your development is in yourselves.
As for me, I never act but through the intervention of
force. I have nothing, absolutely nothing, but what I derive
from you, and for this reason I cannot confer even the smallest
advantage on one except at the expense of another. Cultivate
your fields, then, manufacture and export your products, carry on
trade, afford each other credit, render and receive services freely,
educate your children, set them out in life, cultivate the arts,
improve your minds, refine and purify your tastes and sentiments,
unite, form industrial and charitable associations, join your efforts
for your individual good and that of the public, follow your inclinations,
fulfil your destinies by the free exercise of your powers,
your ideas, and your foresight. Expect from me only two things—Liberty
and Security—and depend upon it you cannot ask me
for a third without losing the other two.”</p>

<p>I am thoroughly persuaded that if the revolution of February
had proclaimed these principles we never should have had another
revolution. Is it possible to conceive that citizens, left perfectly
free in all other respects, would conspire to overturn a Power
<a id="p122" class="xxpn">[p122]</a> whose action was limited to the satisfaction of the most pressing,
the most deeply felt of all our social requirements, the requirements
of Justice?</p>

<p>But it was unfortunately impossible for the National Assembly
to adopt this course, or make these sentiments heard. They were
not in accordance either with the ideas of the Assembly or the expectations
of the public. They would have terrified society as
much as the proclamation of Communism. To be responsible to
ourselves, forsooth! To trust to the State only for the maintenance
of order and peace! To expect from it neither wealth nor
knowledge! To be able no longer to make it responsible for our
faults, our folly, our imprudence! To trust only to ourselves for
the means of subsistence and physical amelioration, or moral and
intellectual improvement! What on earth is to become of us?
Is not society on the eve of being invaded by poverty, ignorance,
error, irreligion, and perversity?</p>

<p>We allow that such undoubtedly would have been the fears
which would have manifested themselves on all sides had the
revolution of February proclaimed Liberty, that is to say, the
reign of the natural laws of society. Then we were either unacquainted
with these laws, or we wanted confidence in them. We
could not get rid of the idea that the motives and springs
of action which God has implanted in the mind of man are
essentially perverse; that rectitude resides nowhere but in the
views and intentions of the governing power; that the tendencies
of human nature lead to disorganization, to anarchy,—in a word,
we believed in the inevitable antagonism of interests.</p>

<p>So far was the revolution of February from displaying any
tendency towards a natural organization, that never were the
hopes and ideas of French society so decidedly turned to artificial
combinations as at that epoch. Which of these combinations was
in most favour? I really cannot very well tell. The business, in
the language of the day, was to make experiments—<em class="e000I2">Faciamus
experimentum in corpore vili</em>. Such was their contempt for individuality,
so thoroughly did they assimilate human nature to inert
matter, that they talked of making social experiments with men,
just as we make chemical experiments with acids and alkalies.
The first tentative was begun at the Luxembourg, we know with
what success. Erelong the Constituent Assembly instituted a
Committee of Labour, in which a thousand social schemes were
engulfed and swallowed up. A Fourierist representative seriously
demanded lands and money (he would soon have asked for
men also) to enable him to manipulate his model society. Another
<a id="p123" class="xxpn">[p123]</a> <em class="e000I2">Egalitaire</em> representative offered his recipe, which was rejected.
The manufacturers were more lucky, and succeeded in maintaining
theirs. In the meantime, the Legislative Assembly named a
commission to organize “assistance.”</p>

<p>Now, what strikes us with surprise in all this is, that the Ruling
Power, for the sake of its own stability, did not from time to time
thus enter its protest:—“You are habituating thirty-six millions of
men to regard the State as responsible for all the good or evil
that may befall them in this world. At this rate, Government is
impossible.”</p>

<p>At any rate, if these various social inventions, dignified with
the high sounding title of organization, differ from each other in
their manner of proceeding, they are all founded on the same
principle: Take from one to give to another. Now such a
principle clearly could not meet with such universal sympathy
from the people, unless they were thoroughly convinced that
men’s interests are naturally antagonistic, and that the tendencies
of human nature are essentially perverse.</p>

<p>To take from one to give to another! I know well that things
have gone on in this way for a long time. But before you set
yourselves to imagine various means of realizing this whimsical
principle for the remedy of existing distress, would it not be well
to inquire whether that distress has not proceeded from the very
fact that this principle in a certain form has been realized already?
Before seeking a remedy in new disturbances of the natural social
laws, should you not make sure that such perturbations do not
themselves constitute the very evil from which society suffers, and
which it is your object to cure?</p>

<p>To take from one in order to give to another! Just allow me
to mark here the danger and the absurdity, in an economical
point of view, of this so-called <em class="e000I2">social</em> aspiration, which, fermenting
among the masses of our population, broke forth with so terrific a
force in the revolution of February.<a
href="#FN_27" id="FNa_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>Where society consists of several grades, we are apt to think
that people of the highest rank enjoy Privileges or Monopolies at
the expense of all the other members of the community. This is
odious, but it is not absurd.</p>

<p>The second grade, the class immediately below the first, will
not fail to attack and batter down monopolies; and, with the
assistance of the masses, they will succeed sooner or later in
bringing about a Revolution. In that case, power passes into
their hands, and they still think that power implies Monopoly.
<a id="p124" class="xxpn">[p124]</a> This is still odious, but it is not absurd, at least it is not impracticable;
for Monopolies are possible as long as there is, below the
grade which enjoys them, a lower stratum—namely, the public at
large, which supports and feeds them. If the third and fourth
grade succeed, in their turn, in effecting a revolution, they will, if
they can, so arrange as to make the most of the masses, by means of
privileges or monopolies skilfully combined. But then the masses,
emaciated, ground down, trampled upon, must also have their
revolution. Why? What are they going to do? You think,
perhaps, that they are going to abolish all monopolies and privileges,
and to inaugurate the reign of universal justice; that they
are about to exclaim—away with restrictions—away with shackles
and trammels—away with monopolies—away with Government
interferences for the profit of certain classes; begone taxes and
grinding impositions; down with political and diplomatic intrigues?
Not at all. They have quite another aim. They become their
own solicitors, and in their turn demand to be <em class="e000I2">privileged</em>! The
public at large, imitating their superiors, ask for monopolies!
They urge their right to employment, their right to credit, their
right to education, their right to assistance! But at whose expense?
They are easy on that score. They feel only that, if
they are ensured employment, credit, education for their children,
repose for their old days, and all gratis, they will be exceedingly
happy; and, truly, no one disputes it. But is it possible? Alas!
no; and this is the reason why I say that here the odious disappears,
and the absurd has reached its climax.</p>

<p>Monopolies to the masses! Good people, reflect a little on the
vicious circle in which you are placing yourselves. Monopoly
implies some one to enjoy it, and some one to pay for it. We
can understand a privileged man, or a privileged class, but not a
privileged people. Is there below you a still lower stratum of
society upon which you can throw back the burden? Will you
never comprehend the whimsical mystification of which you are
the dupes? Will you never understand that the state can give
you nothing with the one hand but what it has taken from you
with the other? that, far from there being for you in this combination
any possible increase of prosperity, the final result of the
operation must be an arbitrary Government, more vexatious, more
exacting, more uncertain, more expensive;—heavier taxes,—more
injustice, more offensive favouritism,—liberty more restrained,—power
thrown away,—occupations, labour, and capital displaced,—covetousness
excited,—discontent provoked,—and individual
energy extinguished? <a id="p125" class="xxpn">[p125]</a></p>

<p>The upper classes have got alarmed, and not without reason, at
this unhappy disposition of the masses. They see in it the germ
of incessant revolutions; for what Government can hold together
which has ventured to say—“I am in possession of force, and I
will employ it to support everybody at the expense of everybody?
I undertake to become responsible for the general happiness.” But
is not the alarm which has seized these classes a just and merited
punishment? Have they not themselves set the people the fatal
example of that grasping disposition of which they now complain?
Have they not had their own eyes perpetually turned to the treasury?
Have they ever failed to secure some monopoly, some
privilege, great or small, to manufactures, to banks, to mines, to
landed property, to the arts, even to the means of diversion, to the
ballet, to the opera, to everything and everybody, in short; except
to the industry of the people—to manual labour? Have they not
multiplied beyond bounds public employments, in order to increase,
at the expense of the people, their own resources? and is there at
this day a single head of a family in France who is not on the
outlook for a <em class="e000I2">place</em> for his son? Have they ever endeavoured to
get rid of any one of the acknowledged inequalities of taxation?
Have they not for a long time turned to account everything, even
the electoral franchise? And yet they are astonished and horrified
that the people should adopt the same course. When the spirit of
mendicity has so long infected the wealthy orders, how can we
suppose that it will not penetrate to the heart of the suffering
masses?</p>

<p>However, a great revolution has taken place. Political power,
the power of making the laws, the disposal of the public force,
has passed virtually, if not yet in fact, into the hands of the
people along with universal suffrage. Thus the people, who have
proposed the problem for solution, will be called upon to solve it
themselves: and woe to the country, if, following the example
which has been set them, they seek its solution in Privilege,
which is always an invasion of another’s rights. They will find
themselves mistaken, and the mistake will bring with it a great
lesson; for if it be possible to violate the rights of the many for
the benefit of the few, how can we violate the rights of all for the
benefit of all? But at what cost will this lesson be taught us?
And, in order to obviate so frightful a danger, what ought the
upper classes to do? Two things—renounce all privileges and
monopolies themselves, and enlighten the masses, for there are
only two things which can save society—Justice and Knowledge.
They ought to inquire with earnestness whether they do not enjoy
<a id="p126" class="xxpn">[p126]</a> some monopoly or other, in order that they may renounce it—whether
they do not profit by some artificial inequalities, in order
that they may efface them—whether Pauperism is not in some
measure attributable to a disturbance of the natural social laws, in
order that they may put an end to it. They should be able to hold
out their hands to the people, and say to them, These hands are
full, but they are clean. Is this what they actually do? If I am
not very much mistaken, they do just the reverse. They begin by
guarding their monopolies, and we have seen them even turning
the revolution to profit by attempting to extend these monopolies.
After having deprived themselves of even the possibility of
speaking the truth and appealing to principles, they endeavour to
vindicate their consistency by engaging to treat the people as they
have treated themselves, and dazzle them with the bait of Privilege.
Only, they think themselves very knowing in conceding at present
only a small privilege, the right to “assistance,” in the hope of
diverting them from demanding a greater one—the right to
employment. They do not perceive that to extend and systematize
more and more the maxim, “Take from one to give to
another,” is only to strengthen the illusion which creates difficulties
for the present and dangers for the future.</p>

<p>We must not exaggerate, however. When the superior classes
seek in privilege a remedy for the evils which privilege has caused,
they are sincere, and act, I am convinced, rather from ignorance
than from any desire to commit injustice. It is an irreparable
misfortune that the governments which have succeeded each other
in France have invariably discouraged the teaching of Political
Economy. And it is a still greater misfortune that University
Education fills all our heads with Roman prejudices; in other
words, with all that is repugnant to social truth. This is what
leads the upper classes astray. It is the fashion at present to
declaim against these classes. For my own part, I believe that at
no period have their intentions been more benevolent. I believe
that they ardently desire to solve the social Problem. I believe
that they would do more than renounce their privileges,—that
they would sacrifice willingly, in works of charity, a part of the
property they have acquired, if by that means they were satisfied
that an end could be put to the sufferings of the working classes.
It may be said, no doubt, that they are actuated by interest or
fear, and that it is no great generosity to abandon a part of their
fortune to save the remainder,—that it is, in fact, but the vulgar
prudence of a man who insures his property against fire. But let
us not thus calumniate human nature. Why should we refuse to
<a id="p127" class="xxpn">[p127]</a> recognise a motive less egotistical? Is it not very natural that
the democratic sentiments which prevail in our country should
render men alive to the sufferings of their brethren? But whatever
may be the dominant sentiment, it cannot be denied that
everything by which public opinion is influenced—philosophy,
literature, poetry, the drama, the pulpit, the tribune, the daily
press,—all these organs of opinion reveal not only a desire, but an
ardent longing, on the part of the wealthier classes to resolve the
great problem. Why, then, is there no movement on the part of
our Legislative Assemblies? Because they are ignorant. Political
Economy proposes to them this solution:—<em class="e00S02">Public Justice</em>,—<em class="e00S02">Private
Charity</em>. But they go off upon a wrong scent, and,
obeying socialist influences, without being aware of the fact, they
give charity a place in the statute-book, thereby banishing justice
from it, and destroying by the same act private charity, which is
ever prompt to recede before a compulsory poor-rate.</p>

<p>Why, then, do our legislators thus run counter to all sound
notions? Why do they not leave things in their proper place,—Sympathy
in its natural domain, which is Liberty,—Justice in its
own, which is Law? Why do they not leave law to do its own
exclusive work in furthering justice? Is it that they have no love
of justice? No; it is that they have no confidence in it. Justice
is Liberty and Property. But they are socialists without knowing
it; and for the progressive diminution of poverty, and the
indefinite expansion of wealth, let them say what they will, they
have no faith either in liberty or property, nor, consequently, in
justice. This is why we see them, in the sincerity of their hearts,
seeking the realization of what is Good by the perpetual violation
of what is Right.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Natural social laws</em> are the phenomena, taken in the aggregate,
and considered in reference both to their motives and their results,
which govern the transactions of men in a state of freedom.</p>

<p>That being granted, the question is, Are we to allow these laws
to act, or are we to hinder them from acting?</p>

<p>The question, in fact, comes to this:</p>

<p>Are we to leave every man master of his liberty and property,
his right to produce, and exchange his produce, as he chooses,
whether to his benefit or detriment; or are we to interfere by
means of law, which is Force, for the protection of these rights?
Or, can we hope to secure a greater amount of social happiness by
violating liberty and property, by interfering with and regulating
labour, by disturbing exchanges, and shifting responsibility?</p>

<p>In other words: <a id="p128" class="xxpn">[p128]</a></p>

<p>Is Law to enforce rigorous Justice, or to be the instrument of
Spoliation, organized with more or less adroitness?</p>

<p>It is very evident that the solution of these questions depends
upon our knowledge and study of the natural laws of society. We
cannot pronounce conclusively upon them until we have discovered
whether property, liberty, the combination of services freely and
voluntarily exchanged, lead to improvement and material prosperity,
as the economists believe, or to ruin and degradation, as
the socialists affirm.</p>

<p>In the first case, social evils must be attributed to disturbances
of the natural laws, to legal violations of liberty and property, and
these disturbances and violations must be put an end to. In that
case Political Economy is right.</p>

<p>In the second case, it may be said, we have not yet had enough
of Government interference. Forced and factitious combinations
have not yet sufficiently superseded free and natural combinations.
These three fatal principles, Justice, Liberty, Property, have still
too powerful a sway. Our legislators have not yet attacked them
boldly enough. We have not yet acted sufficiently on the maxim
of <em class="e000I2">taking from one in order to give to another</em>. Hitherto we have
taken from the many to give to the few. Now, we must take from
all to give to all. In a word, we must organize Spoliation, and
from Socialism must come our salvation.<a
href="#FN_28" id="FNa_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Fatal Illusions which spring from Exchange.</em>—Exchange is
society. Consequently, economic truth consists in a complete
view of Exchange; economic error in a partial view of it.</p>

<p>If man did not exchange, each economic phenomenon would be
accomplished in a single individual, and it would be very easy
to discover from observation its good and its bad effects.</p>

<p>But Exchange has given rise to the separation of occupations,
or, in other words, to the establishment of trades and professions.
Each service (or each product) has, then, two relations, one with
the person who furnishes it, and the other with the person who
receives it.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, at the end of the evolution, man in a social state,
like man in a state of isolation, is at once producer and consumer,
but we must see clearly the difference. Man in an isolated state
is always the producer of the very thing he consumes, which
almost never happens with man in the social state. This is an
unquestionable fact, which every one can verify for himself. It
<a id="p129" class="xxpn">[p129]</a> follows, moreover, from this that the social state consists in an
interchange of services.</p>

<p>We are all producers and consumers, not of the thing, but of
the value, that we have produced. In exchanging commodities
we remain always possessed of their value.</p>

<p>It is this which gives rise to all economic errors and illusions,
and it may not be useless to mark here the progress of the human
mind in this respect.</p>

<p>We give the general name of <em class="e000I2">obstacle</em> to everything which, being
interposed between our wants and our satisfactions, calls for the
intervention of our efforts.</p>

<p>The relations of these four elements—want, obstacle, effort,
satisfaction—are quite apparent, and easily understood in isolated
man. We should never think of saying—</p>

<p>“It is a pity that Robinson Crusoe did not encounter more
<em class="e000I2">obstacles</em>, for in that case he would have had more opportunities
of exerting his energies—he would have been richer.”</p>

<p>“It is unfortunate that the sea should have cast upon the shore
of the desert island useful articles, such as timber, provisions, arms,
books; for this deprived him of the opportunity of exerting himself—it
made him less rich.”</p>

<p>“It is to be regretted that Robinson invented nets to take fish
and game, for that diminished by so much his efforts in relation to
each given result—it made him less rich.”</p>

<p>“It is a pity that Robinson was not more frequently sick, for
then he must have set to doctoring himself, which is labour; and
as all wealth comes from labour, he would have been more wealthy
on that account.”</p>

<p>“It is a pity that he succeeded in extinguishing the fire which
threatened his cabin. He lost thus a precious opportunity of
work—and was so much the poorer.”</p>

<p>“It is unfortunate that in the desert island the soil was not
more ungrateful, the spring at a greater distance, the day shorter.
For then Robinson must have exerted himself more to procure
food, drink, and light, and he would have been so much the richer
by the exertion.”</p>

<p>I say that no one in his senses would ever think of putting forth
as oracles of truth propositions so absurd. It would be too glaring
an evidence that wealth does not depend upon the intensity of the
effort in proportion to the satisfaction obtained, and that it is just
the contrary which is true. We should then understand that
wealth consists neither in the Want, nor in the Obstacle, nor in
the Effort, but in the Satisfaction; and we should not hesitate to
<a id="p130" class="xxpn">[p130]</a> acknowledge that, although Robinson Crusoe was both producer
and consumer, yet, in order to judge of his progress, we must have
reference, not to his labour, but to its results. In short, in laying
down the axiom that “the paramount interest is that of the consumer,”
we believe we are merely giving utterance to a <em class="e000I2">truism</em>.</p>

<p>Happy will it be for nations when they discern clearly how and
why what we have found true or false of man in a state of isolation
is equally true or false of man in his social state!</p>

<p>It is absolutely certain, however, that the five or six propositions
which have appeared to us not only false, but absurd, when applied
to the island of Juan Fernandez, appear, when applied to our own
country, so incontestably true, that they serve as the basis of our
whole economic legislation. On the other hand, the axiom which
appears to us to be truth itself when applied to an individual, is
never invoked in the name of society without calling forth a smile
of contempt.</p>

<p>Is it true, then, that Exchange so alters our individual organization
that what makes individual poverty constitutes social
riches?</p>

<p>No, it is not true, but it is plausible—so very plausible as to
be generally believed.</p>

<p>Society consists in this—that we work for one another. The
more services we render, the more services we receive, and we
receive more in proportion as our own are more appreciated—more
in demand. On the other hand, the separation of occupations,
the division of labour, causes each of us to apply his
efforts to the removal of obstacles which stand in the way of
the enjoyments of others. The agricultural labourer combats the
obstacle called hunger—the physician, the obstacle called disease—the
clergyman, the obstacle called vice—the author, the obstacle
called ignorance—the coal miner, the obstacle called cold, etc., etc.</p>

<p>And as those around us are more disposed to remunerate our
services in proportion as they feel more keenly the particular
obstacle which stands in their own way, it follows that we are
all disposed, in this point of view, and as producers, to magnify
the obstacle which it is our peculiar business to overcome. We
consider ourselves richer if such obstacles are multiplied, and we
reason from particulars to generals—from our own individual advantage
to the public good.<a

<h2 title="V. Of Value"><a id="V"></a>V.<br />
OF VALUE.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
All dissertations are wearisome—a dissertation on Value the most
wearisome of all.</p>

<p>What unpractised writer, who has had to face an Economic
problem, but has tried to resolve it without reference to any definition
of value?</p>

<p>Yet he soon finds he has engaged in a vain attempt. The
theory of Value is to Political Economy what numeration is to
arithmetic. In what inextricable confusion would not Bezout
have landed himself, if, to save labour to his pupils, he had undertaken
to teach them the four rules and proportion, without having
previously explained the value which the figures derive from their
form and position?</p>

<p>The truth is, if the reader could only foresee the beautiful consequences
deducible from the theory of Value, he would undertake
the labour of mastering the first principles of Economical Science
with the same cheerfulness that one submits to the drudgery of
Geometry, in prospect of the magnificent field which it opens to
our intelligence.</p>

<p>But this intuitive foresight is not to be expected; and the more
pains I should take to establish the distinction between Value and
Utility, or between Value and Labour, in order to show how
natural it is that this should form a stumbling-block at the very
threshold of the science, the more wearisome I should become.
The reader would see in such a discussion only barren and idle
subtleties, calculated at best to satisfy the curiosity of Economists
by profession.</p>

<p>You are inquiring laboriously, it may be said, whether wealth
consists in the Utility of things, or in their Value, or in their
rarity. Is not this like the question of the schoolmen, Does form
reside in the substance or in the accident? Are you not afraid
<a id="p132" class="xxpn">[p132]</a> that some street Molière will hold you up to public ridicule at the
Théâtre des Variétés?</p>

<p>Yet truth obliges me to say that, in an economical point of
view, Society is Exchange. The primary element of Exchange
is the notion of <em class="e000I2">Value</em>, so that every truth and every error which
this word introduces into men’s minds is a social truth or error.</p>

<p>I undertake in this work to demonstrate the Harmony of those
laws of Providence which govern human society. What makes
these laws harmonious and not discordant is, that all principles,
all motives, all springs of action, all interests, co-operate towards
a grand final result, which humanity will never reach by reason of
its native <em class="e000I2">imperfection</em>, but to which it will always approximate
more and more by reason of its unlimited <em class="e000I2">capability of improvement</em>.
And that result is, the indefinite approximation of all
classes towards a level, which is always rising; in other words,
the <em class="e000I2">equalization</em> of individuals in the general <em class="e000I2">amelioration</em>.</p>

<p>But to attain my object. I must explain two things, namely,</p>

<p>1<em class="e000I2">st</em>, That <em class="e000I2">Utility</em> has a tendency to become more and more <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>,
more and more <em class="e000I2">common</em>, as it gradually recedes from the
domain of individual <em class="e000I2">appropriation</em>.</p>

<p>2<em class="e000I2">d</em>, That <em class="e000I2">Value</em>, on the other hand, which alone is capable of
appropriation, which alone constitutes property legitimately and
in fact, has a tendency to diminish more and more in relation to
the utility to which it is attached.</p>

<p>Such a demonstration—founded on Property, but only on the
property of which Value is the subject, and on Community, but
only on the community of utility,—such a demonstration, I say,
must satisfy and reconcile all schools, by conceding to them that
all have had a glimpse of the truth, but only of partial truth,
regarded from different points of view.</p>

<p>Economists! you defend property. There is in the social order
no other property than that of which <em class="e000I2">Value</em> is the subject, and that
is immovable and unassailable.</p>

<p>Communists! you dream of Community. You have got it. The
social order renders all <em class="e000I2">utilities</em> common, provided the exchange of
those values which have been appropriated is free.</p>

<p>You are like architects who dispute about a monument of which
each has seen only one side. They don’t see <em class="e000I2">ill</em>, but they don’t
see <em class="e000I2">all</em>. To make them agree, it is only necessary to ask them to
walk round the edifice.</p>

<p>But how am I to reconstruct the social edifice, so as to exhibit
to mankind all its beautiful harmony, if I reject its two corner
stones. Utility and Value? How can I bring about the desired
<a id="p133" class="xxpn">[p133]</a> reconciliation of various schools upon the platform of truth if I
shun the analysis of these two ideas, although the dissidence has
arisen from the unhappy confusion which they have caused?</p>

<p>I have felt this kind of introduction necessary, in order, if possible,
to secure from the reader a moment’s attention, and relieve
him from fatigue and ennui. I am much mistaken if the consoling
beauty of the consequences will not amply make up for the dryness
of the premises. Had Newton allowed himself to be repulsed
at the outset by a distaste for elementary mathematics, never
would his heart have beat with rapture on beholding the harmonies
of the celestial mechanism; and I maintain that it is only
necessary to make our way manfully to an acquaintance with
certain first principles, in order to be convinced that God has
displayed in the social mechanism goodness no less touching,
simplicity no less admirable, splendour no less magnificent.</p>

<p>In the first chapter we viewed man as both <em class="e000I2">active</em> and <em class="e000I2">passive</em>,
and we saw that <em class="e000I2">Want</em> and <em class="e000I2">Satisfaction</em>, acting on <em class="e000I2">sensibility</em> alone,
were in their own nature personal, peculiar, and intransmissible;
that <em class="e000I2">Effort</em>, on the contrary, the connecting link between Want and
Satisfaction, the <em class="e000I2">mean</em> term between the motive principle of action
and the end we have in view, proceeding from our <em class="e000I2">activity</em>, our
spontaneity, our will, was susceptible of conventions and of transmission.
I know that, metaphysically, no one can contest this
assertion, and maintain that Effort also is personal. I have no
desire to enter the territory of ideology, and I hope that my view
of the subject will be admitted without controversy when put in
this vulgar form:—We cannot <em class="e000I2">feel</em> the wants of others—we cannot
<em class="e000I2">feel</em> the satisfactions of others; but we can <em class="e000I2">render service</em> one to
another.</p>

<p>It is this transmission of efforts, this exchange of services, which
forms the subject of Political Economy; and since, on the other
hand, economical science is condensed and summed up in the word
<em class="e000I2">Value</em>, of which it is only a lengthened explanation, it follows that
the notion of value would be imperfectly, erroneously, conceived if
we were to found it upon the extreme phenomena of our sensibility—namely,
our <em class="e000I2">Wants</em> and <em class="e000I2">Satisfactions</em>—phenomena which are
personal, intransmissible, and <em class="e000I2">incommensurable</em> as between two
individuals, in place of founding it on the manifestations of our
<em class="e000I2">activity</em>, upon <em class="e000I2">efforts</em>, upon reciprocal <em class="e000I2">services</em>, which are interchanged
because they are susceptible of being compared, appreciated,
<em class="e000I2">estimated</em>, and which are capable of being estimated precisely
because they are capable of being interchanged.</p>

<p>In the same chapter we arrived at the following formulas:— <a id="p134" class="xxpn">[p134]</a></p>

<p>“<em class="e000I2">Utility</em> (the property which certain things and certain acts
have of serving us, of being useful to us) is complex,—one part
we owe to the action of nature, another to the action of man.”—“With
reference to a given result, the more nature has done the
less remains for human action to do.”—“The co-operation of nature
is essentially <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>—the co-operation of man, whether intellectual
or muscular, exchanged or not, collective or solitary, is
essentially <em class="e000I2">onerous</em>, as indeed the word <em class="e000I2">Effort</em> implies.”</p>

<p>And as what is <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> cannot possess <em class="e000I2">value</em>, since the idea of
<em class="e000I2">value</em> implies <em class="e000I2">onerous</em> acquisition, it follows that the notion of
Value would be still erroneously conceived, if we were to extend
it, in whole or in part, to the gifts or to the co-operation of nature,
instead of restricting it exclusively to human co-operation.</p>

<p>Thus, from both sides, by two different roads, we arrive at this
conclusion, that <em class="e000I2">value</em> must have reference to the <em class="e000I2">efforts</em> which men
make in order to obtain the <em class="e000I2">satisfaction</em> of their <em class="e000I2">wants</em>.</p>

<p>In the third chapter we have established that man cannot exist
in a state of isolation. But if, by an effort of imagination, we
fancy him placed in that chimerical situation, that state <em class="e000I2">contrary to
nature</em>, which the writers of the eighteenth century extolled as the
<em class="e000I2">state of nature</em>, we shall not fail to see that it does not disclose to
us the idea of Value, although it presents the manifestation of the
active principle which we have termed <em class="e000I2">effort</em>. The reason is obvious.
Value implies comparison, appreciation, <em class="e000I2">estimation</em>, measure.
In order that two things should measure each other, it is necessary
that they be commensurable, and, in order to that, they must
be of the same kind. In a state of isolation, with what could we
compare effort? With want? With satisfaction? In that case,
we could go no farther than to pronounce that the effort was more
or less appropriate, more or less opportune. In the social state,
what we compare (and it is this comparison which gives rise to the
idea of Value) is the effort of one man with the effort of another
man,—two phenomena of the same nature, and, consequently,
<em class="e000I2">commensurable</em>.</p>

<p>Thus, the definition of the word Value, in order to be exact,
must have reference not only to human efforts, but likewise to
those efforts which are exchanged or exchangeable. Exchange
does more than exhibit and measure values—it gives them
existence. I do not mean to say that it gives existence to the
acts and the things which are exchanged, but it imparts to their
existence the notion of <em class="e000I2">value</em>.</p>

<p>Now, when two men transfer to each other their present
efforts, or make over mutually the results of their anterior
<a id="p135" class="xxpn">[p135]</a> efforts, they <em class="e000I2">serve</em> each other; they render each other reciprocal
<em class="e000I2">service</em>.</p>

<p>I say, then, <em class="e00S02">Value is the relation of two services exchanged</em>.</p>

<p>The idea of <em class="e000I2">value</em> entered into the world the first time that a man
having said to his brother, Do this for me, and I shall do that for
you—they have come to an agreement; for then, for the first time,
we could say—The two <em class="e000I2">services</em> exchanged are <em class="e000I2">worth each other</em>.</p>

<p>It is singular enough that the true theory of value, which we
search for in vain in many a ponderous volume, is to be found in
Florian’s beautiful fable of <em class="e000I2">l’Aveugle et le Paralytique</em>,—</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="i09">Aidons—nous mutuellement,</p>
<p>La charge des malheurs en sera plus légère.</p>
<p class="i06">&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. A nous deux</p>
<p>Nous possédons le bien à chacun nécessaire.</p>
<p class="i06">J’ai des jambes, et vous des yeux.</p>
<p>Moi, je vais vous porter; vous, vous serez mon guide:</p>
<p>Ainsi, sans que jamais notre amitié décide</p>
<p>Qui de nous deux remplit le plus utile emploi,</p>
<p>Je marcherai pour vous, vous y verrez pour moi.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Here you have value discovered and defined. Here you have
it in its rigorous economic exactitude, excepting the touching trait
relative to friendship, which carries us into another sphere, that of
sympathy. We may conceive two unfortunates rendering each
other reciprocal <em class="e000I2">service</em>, without inquiring too curiously <em class="e000I2">which of
the two discharged the most useful employment</em>. The exceptional
situation imagined by the fabulist explains sufficiently that the
principle of sympathy, acting with great force, comes to absorb, so
to speak, the minute appreciation of the services exchanged—an
appreciation, however, which is indispensable in order to disengage
completely the idea of Value. That idea would be complete
if all men, or the majority of them, were struck with paralysis or
blindness; for the inexorable law of supply and demand would
then predominate, and, causing the permanent sacrifice accepted
by him who fulfils the more useful employment to disappear, would
restore the transaction to the domain of justice.</p>

<p>We are all blind or impotent in some respects, and we soon
come to understand that, by assisting each other, <em class="e000I2">the burden of
misfortune is lightened</em>. Hence <em class="e00S02">Exchange</em>. We labour in order
to feed, clothe, shelter, enlighten, cure, defend, instruct one another.
Hence reciprocal <em class="e00S02">Services</em>. We compare, we discuss, we <em class="e000I2">estimate</em>
or <em class="e000I2">appreciate</em> these services. Hence <em class="e00S02">Value</em>.</p>

<p>A multitude of circumstances may augment the relative importance
of a Service. We find it greater or less, according as it is
more or less useful to us—according as a greater or less number of
<a id="p136" class="xxpn">[p136]</a> people are disposed to render it to us—according as it exacts from
them more or less labour, trouble, skill, time, previous study,—and
according as it saves more or less of these to ourselves. Value
depends not only on these circumstances, but on the judgment we
form of them; for it may happen, and it happens frequently, that
we esteem a service very highly because we judge it very useful,
while in reality it is hurtful. This is the reason why vanity,
ignorance, error, exert a certain influence on the essentially elastic
and flexible relation which we denominate <em class="e000I2">value</em>; and we may
affirm that the appreciation of services tends to approximate more
to absolute truth and justice in proportion as men become more
enlightened, more moral, and more refined.</p>

<p>Hitherto the principle of Value has been sought for in one of
those circumstances which augment or which diminish it, materiality,
durableness, utility, scarcity, labour, difficulty of acquisition,
judgment, etc., and hence a false direction has been given to
the science from the beginning; for the accident which modifies the
phenomenon is not the phenomenon itself. Moreover, each author
has constituted himself the sponsor, so to speak, of some special
circumstance which he thinks preponderates,—the constant result
of generalizing; for all is in all, and there is nothing which we
cannot comprehend under a term by means of extending its sense.
Thus the principle of value, according to Adam Smith, resides in
materiality and durability; according to Jean Baptiste Say, in
utility; according to Ricardo, in labour; according to Senior, in
rarity; according to Storch, in the judgment we form, etc.</p>

<p>The consequence has been what might have been expected.
These authors have unwittingly injured the authority and dignity
of the science by appearing to contradict each other; while in
reality each is right, as from his own point of view. Besides,
they have involved the first principles of Political Economy in a
labyrinth of inextricable difficulties; for the same words, as used
by these authors, no longer represent the same ideas; and, moreover,
although a circumstance may be proclaimed fundamental,
other circumstances stand out too prominently to be neglected, and
definitions are thus constantly enlarged.</p>

<p>The object of the present work is not controversy, but exposition.
I explain what I myself see, not what others have seen. I
cannot avoid, however, calling the attention of the reader to the
circumstances in which the foundation of Value has hitherto been
sought for. But, first of all, I must bring Value itself before him
in a series of examples, for it is by divers applications that the
mind lays hold of a theory. <a id="p137" class="xxpn">[p137]</a></p>

<p>I shall demonstrate how all is definitely resolved into a barter
of services; but it is necessary to keep in mind what has been
said on the subject of barter in the preceding chapter. It is rarely
simple—sometimes it forms a circular or round-about transaction
among several parties,—most frequently, by the intervention of
money, it resolves itself into two factors, <em class="e000I2">sale</em> and <em class="e000I2">purchase</em>; but as
this complication does not change its nature, I may be permitted,
for the sake of perspicuity, to assume the barter to be direct and
immediate. This will lead to no mistake as to the nature of Value.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>We are all born with an imperious material want, which must
be satisfied under pain of death, I mean that of breathing. On the
other hand, we all exist in a medium which, in general, supplies
that want without the intervention of any effort on our part.
Atmospheric air, then, has utility without having <em class="e000I2">value</em>. It has
no Value, because, requiring no Effort, it gives rise to no service.
To render a service to any one is to save him trouble; and where
it is not necessary to take pains in order to realize a satisfaction,
no trouble can be saved.</p>

<p>But if a man descend to the bottom of a river in a diving-bell,
a foreign substance is interposed between the air and his lungs,
and, in order to re-establish the communication, a pump must be
employed. Here there is an effort to make, pains to take, and the
man below desires the exertion, for it is a matter of life or death,
and he cannot possibly secure to himself a greater <em class="e000I2">service</em>.</p>

<p>Instead of making this effort himself, he calls on me to make it
for him, and, in order to induce me to do so, he undertakes in turn
to make an exertion from which I may reap satisfaction. We
discuss the matter, and come to an agreement. Now, what do we
discover here? two wants, two satisfactions, which are not inconsistent
with each other; two efforts, which are the subject of a
voluntary transaction; two <em class="e000I2">services</em>, which are exchanged,—and
<em class="e000I2">value</em> makes its appearance.</p>

<p>Now, we are told that utility is the foundation of value; and as
utility is inherent in the air, we are led to think that it is the same
in regard to value. There is here an evident confusion of ideas.
The air, from its nature, has physical properties in harmony with
one of our physical organs, the lungs. The portion which I draw
from the atmosphere in order to fill the diving-bell does not change
its nature—it is still oxygen and azote. No new physical quality
is combined with it, no reacting power brings out of it a new
element called <em class="e000I2">value</em>. <em class="e000I2">That</em> springs exclusively from the service
rendered. <a id="p138" class="xxpn">[p138]</a></p>

<p>If, in laying down the general principle, that Utility is the
foundation of Value, you mean that the Service has value because
it is useful to him who receives it and pays for it, I allow
the truth of what you say. It is a truism implied in the very
word <em class="e000I2">service</em>.</p>

<p>But we must not confound the utility of the air with the utility
of the service. They are two utilities distinct from each other,
different in nature, different in kind, which bear no proportion to
one another, and have no necessary relation. There are circumstances
in which, with very slight exertion, by rendering a very
small service, or saving very little trouble, I may bring within the
reach of another an article of very great intrinsic <em class="e000I2">utility</em>.</p>

<p>Take the case of the diving-bell, and consider how the parties
to the supposed bargain manage to estimate the value of the <em class="e000I2">service</em>
rendered by the one to the other in supplying him with
atmospheric air. We must have a point of comparison, and that
point of comparison can only be in the <em class="e000I2">service</em> which the diver
renders in return. Their reciprocal demands will depend on their
relative situation, on the intensity of their desires, on the greater
or less need they have of each other, and on a multitude of circumstances
which demonstrate that the value is in the Service, since
it increases with the service.</p>

<p>The reader may easily vary the hypothesis, so as to convince
himself that the Value is not necessarily proportionate to the
intensity of the efforts,—a remark which I set down here as a
connecting link in the chain of reasoning, and of which I shall
afterwards have occasion to make use; for my object is to prove
that Value no more resides in labour than it does in utility.</p>

<p>Nature has so constituted me that I must die if I am deprived
of an opportunity, from time to time, of quenching my thirst, and
the well is a league from the village. For this reason, I take the
trouble every morning to go thither to fetch the water of which I
have need, for in water I have recognised those <em class="e000I2">useful</em> qualities
which are calculated to assuage the suffering called thirst. Want,
Effort, Satisfaction—we have them all here. I have found Utility—I
have not yet found Value.</p>

<p>But, as my neighbour goes also to the fountain, I say to him—“<em class="e000I2">Save
me the pains</em> of this journey—<em class="e000I2">render me the service</em> of bringing
me water. During the time you are so occupied, I shall do
something for you, I shall teach your child to spell.” This arrangement
suits us both. Here is an exchange of two services, and we
are enabled to pronounce that the one is <em class="e000I2">worth</em> the other. The
things compared here are two efforts, not two wants and two <a id="p139" class="xxpn">[p139]</a>
satisfactions;
for by what common standard should we compare the
benefit of drinking water and that of learning to spell?</p>

<p>By-and-by I say to my neighbour—“Your child troubles me—I
should like better to do something else for you. You shall
continue to bring me water, and I shall give you twopence.” If
the proposal is agreed to, the Economist may, without fear of mistake,
pronounce that <em class="e000I2">the service</em> <em class="e0U003">IS WORTH</em> <em class="e000I2">twopence</em>.</p>

<p>Afterwards, my neighbour no longer waits to be requested. He
knows by experience that every day I want water. He anticipates
my wishes. At the same time, he provides water for the
other villagers. In short, he becomes a water merchant. It is
then that we begin to say, <em class="e000I2">the water</em> <em class="e0U003">IS WORTH</em> <em class="e000I2">twopence</em>.</p>

<p>Has the water, then, changed its nature? Has the Value, which
was but now in the service, become materialized and incorporated
in the water, as if it were a new chemical element? Has a slight
modification in the form of the arrangement between my neighbour
and me had the power to displace the principle of <em class="e000I2">value</em> and change
its nature? I am not purist enough to find fault with your saying
that the <em class="e000I2">water is worth twopence</em>, just as you say <em class="e000I2">the sun sets</em>. But
we must remember that metaphors and metonymies do not affect
the truth of facts; and that, in strict scientific language, value can
no more be said to reside in the water than the sun can be said to
go to rest in the sea.</p>

<p>Let us attribute, then, to things the peculiar qualities which
belong to them—to air, to water, <em class="e000I2">utility</em>—to services, <em class="e000I2">value</em>. We
may say with propriety that water is <em class="e000I2">useful</em>, because it has the
property of allaying thirst; and it is the service which <em class="e000I2">has value</em>,
because it is the subject of a convention previously debated and
discussed. So true is this, that if the well is brought nearer, or
removed to a greater distance, the Utility of the water remains the
same, but its value is diminished or increased. Why? because
the <em class="e000I2">service</em> is less or greater. The <em class="e000I2">value</em>, then, is in the <em class="e000I2">service</em>,
seeing that it is increased or diminished according as the service is
increased or diminished.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">diamond</em> makes a great figure in works of Political Economy.
It is adduced as an illustration of the laws of Value, or of
the supposed disturbance of those laws. It is a brilliant weapon
with which all the schools do battle. The English school asserts
that “Value resides in labour.” The French school exhibits a
diamond, and says—“Here is a commodity which exacts no
labour and yet is of immense value.” The French school affirms
that the foundation of value is utility, and the English school
immediately brings forward the diamond in opposition to the
<a id="p140" class="xxpn">[p140]</a> illustrations drawn from air, light, and water. “The air is very
useful,” says the English Economist, “but it possesses no value;
the <em class="e000I2">utility</em> of the diamond is almost inappreciable, and yet it possesses
more <em class="e000I2">value</em> than the whole atmosphere;” and the reader is
inclined to say with Henri Quatre—“In sooth, they are both
right.” They end by landing themselves in an error more fatal
than both the others, and are forced to avow that <em class="e000I2">value</em> resides in
the works of nature, and that that value is <em class="e000I2">material</em>.</p>

<p>My definition, as it seems to me, gets rid of these anomalies,
and is confirmed rather than invalidated by the illustration which
has been adduced.</p>

<p>I take a walk along the sea-beach, and I find by chance a magnificent
diamond. I am thus put in possession of a great <em class="e000I2">value</em>.
Why? Am I about to confer a great benefit on the human race?
Have I devoted myself to a long and laborious work? Neither
the one nor the other. Why, then, does this diamond possess so
much value? Undoubtedly because the person to whom I transfer
it considers that I have rendered him a great <em class="e000I2">service</em>,—all the
greater that many rich people desire it, and that I alone can
render it. The grounds of his judgment may be controverted—be
it so. It may be founded on pride, on vanity—granted
again. But this judgment has, nevertheless, been formed by a
man who is disposed to act upon it, and that is sufficient for my
argument.</p>

<p>Far from the judgment being based on a reasonable appreciation
of <em class="e000I2">utility</em>, we may allow that the very reverse is the case.
Ostentation makes great sacrifices for what is utterly <em class="e000I2">useless</em>.</p>

<p>In this case, the value, far from bearing a necessary proportion
to the labour <em class="e000I2">performed</em> by the person who renders the service,
may be said rather to bear proportion to the labour <em class="e000I2">saved</em> to the
person who receives it. This general law of value, which has not,
so far as I know, been observed by theoretical writers, nevertheless
prevails universally in practice. We shall explain afterwards
the admirable mechanism by which value tends to proportion
itself to labour when it is free; but it is not the less true that it
has its principle and foundation less in the effort of the person
who <em class="e000I2">serves</em> than in the effort saved to him who <em class="e000I2">is served</em>.</p>

<p>The transaction relative to the diamond may be supposed to
give rise to the following dialogue:—</p>

<p>“Give me your diamond, Sir.”</p>

<p>“With all my heart; give me in exchange your labour for an
entire year.” <a id="p141" class="xxpn">[p141]</a></p>

<p>“Your acquisition has not cost you a minute’s work.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Sir, try to find a similar lucky minute.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but, in strict equity, the exchange ought to be one of
<em class="e000I2">equal labour</em>.”</p>

<p>“No; in strict equity, you put a value on your own services, and
I upon mine; I don’t force you; why should you lay a constraint
upon me? Give me a whole year’s labour, or seek out a diamond
for yourself.”</p>

<p>“But that might entail upon me ten years’ work, and would
probably end in nothing. It would be wiser and more profitable
to devote these ten years to another employment.”</p>

<p>“It is precisely on that account that I imagined I was rendering
you a <em class="e000I2">service</em> in asking for only one year’s work. I thus save you
nine, and that is the reason why I attach great <em class="e000I2">value</em> to the <em class="e000I2">service</em>.
If I appear to you exacting, it is because you regard only
the labour which I have performed; but consider also the labour
which I save you, and you will find me reasonable in my
demand.”</p>

<p>“It is not the less true that you profit by a work of nature.”</p>

<p>“And if I were to give away what I have found for little or
nothing, it is you who would profit by it. Besides, if this diamond
possesses great value, it is not because nature has been elaborating
it since the beginning of time: she does as much for a drop of dew.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but if diamonds were as common as dew-drops, you could
no longer lay down the law to me, and make your own conditions.”</p>

<p>“Very true; because, in that case, you would not address yourself
to me, or would not be disposed to recompense me highly for
a <em class="e000I2">service</em> which you could easily perform for yourself.”</p>

<p>The result of this dialogue is, that Value no more resides in the
diamond than in the air or in the water. It resides exclusively in
the <em class="e000I2">services</em> which we suppose to be rendered and received with reference
to these things, and is determined by the free bargaining
of the parties who make the exchange.</p>

<p>Take up the <em class="e000I2">Collection des Économistes</em>, and read and compare
all the definitions which you will find there. If there be one of
them which meets the cases of the air and the diamond, two cases
in appearance so opposite, throw this book into the fire. But if
the definition which I propose, simple as it is, solves, or rather
obviates, the difficulty, you are bound in conscience, gentle reader,
to go on to the end of the work, or it is in vain that we have
placed an inviting sign-board over the vestibule of the science.</p>

<p>Allow me to give some more examples, in order to elucidate
clearly my thoughts, and familiarize the reader with a new definition.
By exhibiting this fundamental principle in different aspects,
<a id="p142" class="xxpn">[p142]</a> we shall clear the way for a thorough comprehension of the consequences,
which I venture to predict will be found no less important
than unexpected.</p>

<p>Among the wants to which our physical constitution subjects us
is that of food; and one of the articles best fitted to satisfy that
want is Bread.</p>

<p>As the need of food is personal to me, I should, naturally,
myself perform all the operations necessary to provide the needful
supply of bread. I can the less expect my fellow-men to render
me gratuitously this service, that they are themselves subject to
the same want, and condemned to the same exertion.</p>

<p>Were I to make my own bread, I must devote myself to a labour
infinitely more complicated, but strictly analogous to that which
the necessity of fetching water from the spring would have imposed
upon me. The elements of bread exist everywhere in nature. As
J. B. Say has judiciously remarked, it is neither possible nor
necessary for man to create anything. Gases, salts, electricity,
vegetable life, all exist; my business is to unite them, assist them,
combine them, transport them, availing myself of that great laboratory
called the earth, in which mysteries are accomplished from
which human science has scarcely raised the veil. If the operations
to which I must devote myself in the pursuit of my design
are in the aggregate very complicated, each of them, taken singly,
is as simple as the act of drawing water from the fountain. Every
effort I make is simply a service which I render to myself; and if,
in consequence of a bargain freely entered into, it happens that
other persons save me some of these efforts, or the whole of them,
these are so many <em class="e000I2">services</em> which I receive. The aggregate of
these services, compared with those which I render in return, constitute
the value of the Bread and determine its amount.</p>

<p>A convenient intermediate commodity intervenes to facilitate
this exchange of services, and even to serve as a measure of their
relative importance—Money. But this makes no substantial
difference,—the principle remains exactly the same, just as in
mechanics the transmission of forces is subject to the same law,
whether there be one or several intermediate wheels.</p>

<p>This is so true that, when the loaf is worth fourpence, for
example, if a good bookkeeper wishes to analyze its value, he will
succeed in discovering, amid the multiplicity of transactions which
go to the accomplishment of the final result, all those whose services
have contributed to form that value,—all those who have
saved labour to the man who finally pays for it as the consumer.
He discovers, first of all, the baker, who retains his five per cent.,
<a id="p143" class="xxpn">[p143]</a> and from that percentage remunerates the mason who has built
his oven, the wood-cutter who prepares his billets, etc. Then
comes the miller, who receives not only the recompense of his own
labour, but the means of remunerating the quarryman who has
furnished his millstones, the labourer who has formed his dam,
etc. Other portions of the total value go to the thresher, the
reaper, the labourer, the sower, until you account for the last
farthing. No part of it assuredly goes to remunerate God and
nature. The very idea is absurd, and yet this is rigorously implied
in the theory of the Economists, who attribute a certain
portion of the value of a product to matter or natural forces. No;
we still find that what <em class="e000I2">has value</em> is not the Loaf, but the series of
<em class="e000I2">services</em> which have put me in possession of it.</p>

<p>It is true that, among the elementary parts of the value of the
loaf, our book-keeper will find one which he will have difficulty in
connecting with a <em class="e000I2">service</em>, at least a service implying effort. He
will find of the fourpence, of which the price is made up, a part
goes to the proprietor of the soil, to the man who has the keeping
of the laboratory. That small portion of the value of the loaf
constitutes what is called the <em class="e000I2">rent of land</em>; and, misled by the form
of expression, by the metonymy which again makes its appearance
here, our calculator may be tempted to think that this portion is
allotted to natural agents—to the soil itself.</p>

<p>I maintain that, if he exercises sufficient skill, he will find that
this is still the price of real <em class="e000I2">services</em>—services of the same kind as
all the others. This will be demonstrated with the clearest evidence
when we come to treat of <em class="e000I2">landed property</em>. At present, I
shall only remark, that I am not concerned here with property,
but with <em class="e000I2">value</em>. I don’t inquire whether all services are real and
legitimate, or whether men do not sometimes succeed in getting
paid for services which they do not render. The world, alas! is
full of such injustices, but <em class="e000I2">rent</em> must not be included among them.</p>

<p>All that I have to demonstrate here is, that the pretended value
of <em class="e000I2">commodities</em> is only the value of <em class="e000I2">services</em>, real or imaginary,
received and rendered in connexion with them—that value does
not reside in the commodities themselves, and is no more to be
found in the loaf than in the diamond, the water, or the air—that
no part of the remuneration goes to nature—that it proceeds from
the final consumer of the article, and is distributed exclusively
among men,—and that it would not be accorded to them by him
for any other reason than that they have rendered him services,
unless, indeed, in the case of violence or fraud.</p>

<p>Two men agree that ice is a good thing in summer, and coal a
<a id="p144" class="xxpn">[p144]</a> still better thing in winter. They supply two of our wants—the
one cools, the other warms us. We do not fail to remark that the
Utility of these commodities consists in certain <em class="e000I2">material</em> properties
suitably adapted to our <em class="e000I2">material</em> organs. We remark, moreover,
that among those properties, which physics and chemistry might
enumerate, we do not find <em class="e000I2">value</em>, or anything like it. How, then,
have we come to regard value as inherent in matter and material?</p>

<p>If the two men we have supposed wished to obtain the satisfaction
of their wants, without acting in concert, each would labour
to provide for himself both the articles wanted. If they came to
an understanding, the one would provide coal for two from the
coal-mine, the other ice for two from the mountain. This presupposes
a bargain. They must then adjust the relation of the
two services exchanged. They would take all circumstances into
account—the difficulties to be overcome, the dangers to be braved,
the time to be spent, the pains to be taken, the skill to be displayed,
the risks to be run, the possibility of providing for their wants in
some other way, etc., etc. When they came to an understanding,
the Economist would say, The two <em class="e000I2">services</em> exchanged <em class="e000I2">are worth</em>
each other. In common language, it would be said by metonymy—Such
a quantity of coal <em class="e000I2">is worth</em> such a quantity of ice, as if the
value had passed physically into these bodies. But it is easy to
see that if the common form of expression enables us to state the
results, the scientific expression alone reveals to us the true causes.</p>

<p>In place of two services and two persons, the agreement may
embrace a greater number, substituting a complex Exchange for
simple Barter. In that case, money would intervene to facilitate
the exchange. Need I say that the principle of value would be
neither changed nor displaced?</p>

<p>But I must add here a single observation <em class="e000I2">àpropos</em> of coal. It
may be that there is only one coal-mine in a country, and that an
individual has got possession of it. If so, this man will make
conditions; that is to say, he will put a high price upon his <em class="e000I2">services</em>,
or pretended <em class="e000I2">services</em>.</p>

<p>We have not yet come to the question of right and justice, to
the distinction between true and loyal services, and those that are
fraudulent and pretended. What concerns us at this moment is,
to consolidate the true theory of value, and to disembarrass it of
one error with which Economical science is infected. When we
say that what nature has done or given, she has done or given
<em class="e000I2">gratuitously</em>, and that the notion of <em class="e000I2">value</em> is excluded, we are
answered by an analysis of the price of coal, or some other natural
product. It is acknowledged, indeed, that the greater part of this
<a id="p145" class="xxpn">[p145]</a> price is the remuneration of the services of man. One man has
excavated the ground, another has drained away the water, another
has raised the fuel to the surface, another has transported it to its
destination; and it is the aggregate of these works, it is allowed,
which constitutes <em class="e000I2">nearly</em> the entire <em class="e000I2">value</em>. Still there remains one
portion of the <em class="e000I2">value</em> which does not correspond with any labour or
<em class="e000I2">service</em>. This is the value of the coal as it lies under the soil, still
virgin, and untouched by human labour. It forms the share of
the proprietor; and, since this portion of Value is not of human
creation, it follows necessarily that it is the creation of nature.</p>

<p>I reject that conclusion, and I premonish the reader that, if he
admits it to a greater or less extent, he cannot proceed a single
step farther in the science. No; the action of nature does not
create Value, any more than the action of man creates matter.
Of two things one: either the proprietor has usefully co-operated
towards the final result, and has rendered real services, and then
the portion of value which he has conferred on the coal enters into
my definition; or else he obtrudes himself as a parasite, and, in
that case, he has had the address to get paid for <em class="e000I2">services</em> which he
has not rendered, and the price of the coal is unduly augmented.
That circumstance may prove, indeed, that injustice has entered
into the transaction; but it cannot overturn the theory so as to
authorize us to say that this portion of value is material,—that it
is combined as a physical element with the gratuitous gifts of
Providence. Here is the proof of it. Cause the injustice to cease,
if injustice there be, and the corresponding value will disappear,
which it assuredly would not have done had the value been inherent
in matter and of natural creation.<a
href="#FN_30" id="FNa_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Let us now pass to one of our most imperious wants, that of
<em class="e000I2">security</em>.</p>

<p>A certain number of men land upon an inhospitable coast.
They begin to work. But each of them finds himself constantly
drawn away from his employment by the necessity of defending
himself against wild beasts, or men still more savage. Besides
the time and the exertion which he devotes directly to the work
of defence, he has to provide himself with arms and munitions.
At length it is discovered that, on the whole, infinitely less power
and effort would be wasted if some of them, abandoning other
work, were to devote themselves exclusively to this <em class="e000I2">service</em>. This
<a id="p146" class="xxpn">[p146]</a> duty is assigned to those who are most distinguished for address,
courage, and vigour—and they improve in an art which they make
their exclusive business. Whilst they watch over the public
safety, the community reaps from its labours, now no longer interrupted,
more satisfactions <em class="e000I2">for all</em> than it loses by the diversion
of ten men from other avocations. This arrangement is in consequence
made. What do we see in it but a new progress in the
<em class="e000I2">division of occupations</em>, inducing and requiring an exchange of
<em class="e000I2">services</em>?</p>

<p>Are the services of these soldiers, guards, militiamen, or whatever
you may call them, <em class="e000I2">productive</em>? Undoubtedly they are,
seeing that the sole object of the arrangement is to increase the
proportion which the aggregate Satisfactions of the community
bear to the general efforts.</p>

<p>Have they <em class="e000I2">Value</em>? They must have it, since we esteem them,
appreciate them, <em class="e000I2">estimate</em> their worth, and, in fine, pay for them
with other <em class="e000I2">services</em> with which they are compared.</p>

<p>The form in which this remuneration is stipulated for, the mode
of levying it, the process we adopt in adjusting and concluding
the arrangement, make no alteration on the principle. Are there
efforts saved to some men by others? Are there satisfactions
procured for some by others? In that case there are <em class="e000I2">services</em>
exchanged, compared, <em class="e000I2">estimated</em>;—there is <em class="e000I2">Value</em>.</p>

<p>The kind of services we are now discussing, when social complications
occur, lead sometimes to frightful consequences. The
very nature of the services which we demand from this class of
functionaries requires us to put into their hands Power,—power
sufficient to subdue all resistance,—and it sometimes happens that
they abuse it, and turn it against the very community which
employs them. Deriving from the community services proportioned
to the want we have of <em class="e000I2">security</em>, they themselves may
cause insecurity, in order to display their own importance, and,
by a too skilful diplomacy, involve their fellow-citizens in perpetual
wars.</p>

<p>All this has happened, and still happens. Great disturbances
of the just equilibrium of reciprocal services are the result of it.
But it makes no change in the fundamental principle and scientific
theory of Value.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>I must still give another example or two; but I pray the reader
to believe that I feel quite as much as he can how tiresome and
fatiguing this series of hypotheses must be—throwing us back, as
they all do, on the same kind of proof, tending to the same <a id="p147" class="xxpn">[p147]</a> conclusion,
expressed in the same terms. He must understand, however,
that this process, if not the most interesting, is at least the
surest way of establishing the true theory of Value, and of thus
clearing the road we have to traverse.</p>

<p>We suppose ourselves in Paris. In that great metropolis there
is a vast fermentation of desires, and abundant means also of
satisfying them. Multitudes of rich men, or men in easy circumstances,
devote themselves to industry, to the arts, to politics—and
in the evening they are all eager to obtain an hour’s recreation.
Among the amusements which they relish most is the
pleasure of hearing the music of Rossini sung by Malibran, or
the admirable poetry of Racine interpreted by Rachel. There
are in the world only two women who can furnish these noble
and delicate kinds of entertainment, and unless we could subject
them to torture, which would probably not succeed, we have no
other way of procuring their services but by addressing ourselves
to their good will. Thus the services which we expect from
Malibran and Rachel are possessed of great <em class="e000I2">Value</em>. This explanation
is prosaic enough, but it is true.</p>

<p>If an opulent banker should desire to gratify his vanity by
having the performances of one of these great <em class="e000I2">artistes</em> in his
<em class="e000I2">salons</em>, he will soon find by experience the full truth of my theory.
He desires a rich treat, a lively satisfaction—he desires it eagerly—and
only one person in the world can furnish it. He cannot
procure it otherwise than by offering a large remuneration.</p>

<p>Between what extreme limits will the transaction oscillate?
The banker will go on till he reaches the point at which he
prefers rather to lose the satisfaction than to pay what he deems
an extravagant price for it; the singer to that point at which
she prefers to accept the remuneration offered, rather than not
be remunerated at all. This point of equilibrium determines the
value of this particular service, as it does of all others. It may be
that in many cases custom fixes this delicate point. There is too
much taste in the <em class="e000I2">beau monde</em> to <em class="e000I2">higgle</em> about certain services.
The remuneration may even be gracefully disguised, so as to veil
the vulgarity of the economic law. That law, however, presides
over this transaction, just as it does over the most ordinary bargain;
and Value does not change its nature because experience or
urbanity dispenses with discussing it formally on every occasion.</p>

<p>This explains how <em class="e000I2">artistes</em> above the usual standard of excellence
succeed in realizing great fortunes. Another circumstance favours
them. Their services are of such a nature that they can render
them, at one and the same time, and by one and the same effort, to
<a id="p148" class="xxpn">[p148]</a> a multitude of individuals. However large the theatre, provided
the voice of Rachel can fill it, each spectator enjoys the full
pleasure of her inimitable declamation. This is the foundation
of a new arrangement. Three or four thousand people, all experiencing
the same desire, may come to an understanding, and
raise the requisite sum; and the contribution of each to the remuneration
of the great <em class="e000I2">tragedienne</em> constitutes the equivalent of
the unique service rendered by her to all at once. Such is <em class="e000I2">Value</em>.</p>

<p>As a great number of auditors may combine in order to witness
an entertainment of this description, so a number of actors may
combine in order to perform in an opera or play. Managers may
intervene, to save them the trouble of a multiplicity of trifling
accessory arrangements. Value is thus multiplied, ramified, distributed,
and rendered complex—but it does not change its nature.</p>

<p>We shall finish with some exceptional cases. Such cases form
the best test of a sound theory. When the rule is correct, exceptions
do not invalidate, but confirm it.</p>

<p>An aged priest moves slowly along, pensive, with staff in hand,
and breviary under his arm. His air is serene, his countenance
expressive,—he looks inspired! Where is he going? Do you
see that church in the distance? The youthful village parson,
distrustful as yet of his own powers, has called to his assistance
the old missionary. But first of all he has some arrangements to
make. The preacher will find, indeed, food and shelter at the
parsonage—but he must live from one year’s end to another.
Mons. le Curé, then, has promoted a subscription among the rich
people of the village, moderate in amount, but sufficient; for the
aged pastor is not exacting, and answered the person who wrote to
him—“Du pain pour moi, voilà mon nécessaire; une obole pour le
pauvre, voilà mon superflu.”</p>

<p>Thus are the economic preliminaries complied with; for this
meddling Political Economy creeps into everything, and is to be
found everywhere—<em class="e000I2">Nil humani a me alienum puto</em>.</p>

<p>Let us enlarge a little on this example, which is very apposite
to what we are now discussing.</p>

<p>Here you have an exchange of services. On the one hand you
have an old man who devotes his time, his strength, his talents,
his health, to enlighten the minds of a few villagers, and raise them
to a higher moral level. On the other hand, bread for a few days,
and a hat and cassock, are assured to the man of eloquence.</p>

<p>But there is something more here. There is a rivalry of sacrifices.
The old priest refuses everything that is not absolutely indispensable.
Of that poor pittance the curé takes one half on his
<a id="p149" class="xxpn">[p149]</a> own shoulders; the village Crœsuses exempt their brethren from
the other half, who nevertheless profit by the sermons.</p>

<p>Do these sacrifices invalidate our definition of value? Not at
all. Each is free to render his services only on such terms as are
agreeable to himself. If these conditions are made easy, or if
none are stipulated for, what is the consequence? The <em class="e000I2">service</em>,
preserving its utility, loses its value. The old priest is persuaded
that his services will find their reward in another world, and he
cares not for their being recompensed here below. He feels, no
doubt, that he is rendering a service to his auditors in addressing
them, but he also feels that they do him a service in listening to
him. Hence it follows that the transaction is based upon advantage
to one of the contracting parties, with the full consent of the
other. That is all. In general, exchanges are determined and
estimated by reference to self-interest; but, thank God, that is
not always the case: they are sometimes based on the principle of
sympathy, and in that case we either transfer to another a satisfaction
which we might have reserved for ourselves, or we make
an effort for him which we might have devoted to our own profit
and advantage. Generosity, devotion, self-sacrifice, are impulses
of our nature, which, like many other circumstances, influence the
actual <em class="e000I2">value</em> of a particular service, but they make no change on
the general law of <em class="e000I2">values</em>.</p>

<p>In contrast to this consoling example, I might adduce another
of a very opposite character. In order that a service should possess
value, in the economical sense of the word, it is not at all
indispensable that it should be a real, conscientious, and useful
service; it is sufficient that it is accepted, and paid for by another
service. The world is full of people who palm upon the public
services of a quality more than doubtful, and make the public pay
for them. All depends on the <em class="e000I2">judgment</em> which we form in each
case; and this is the reason why morals will be always the best
auxiliary of Political Economy.</p>

<p>Impostors succeed in propagating a false belief. They represent
themselves as the ambassadors of Heaven. They open at pleasure
the gates of heaven or of hell. When this belief has once taken
firm root, “Here,” say they, “are some little images to which we
have communicated the virtue of securing eternal happiness to
those who carry them about their persons. In bestowing upon
you one of these images, we render you an immense <em class="e000I2">service</em>. You
must render us, then, certain <em class="e000I2">services</em> in return.” Here you have
a <em class="e000I2">Value</em> created. It is founded on a false appreciation, you say,
and that is true. We might say as much of many material things
<a id="p150" class="xxpn">[p150]</a> which possess a certain value, for they would find purchasers if set
up to auction. Economic science would become impossible if we
admitted as values only values correctly and judiciously appreciated.
At every step we must begin a new course of the moral
and physical sciences. In a state of isolation, depraved desires
and a warped intelligence may cause a man to pursue with great
effort and exertion a chimerical satisfaction—a delusion. In like
manner, in the social state, it sometimes happens, as the philosopher
says, that we buy regret too dear. But if truth is naturally
more in keeping with the human mind than error, all these frauds
are destined to disappear—all these delusive services to be spurned
and lose their <em class="e000I2">value</em>. Civilisation will, in the long-run, put everybody
and everything in the right place.</p>

<p>But we must conclude this analysis, which has already extended
to too great a length. Among the various wants of our nature,
respiration, hunger, thirst—and the wants and desires which take
their rise in our vanity, in our heads, hearts, and opinions, in our
hopes for the future, whether well or ill grounded—everywhere we
have sought for Value—and we have found it wherever an <em class="e000I2">exchange
of service</em> takes place. We have found it everywhere of the same
nature, based upon a principle clear, simple, absolute, although
influenced by a multitude of varying circumstances. We might
have passed in review all our other wants; we might have cited
the carpenter, the mason, the manufacturer, the tailor, the physician,
the officer of justice, the lawyer, the merchant, the painter,
the judge, the president of the republic, and we should have found
exactly the same thing. Frequently a material substance; sometimes
forces furnished <em class="e000I2">gratuitously</em> by nature; always human services
interchanged, measuring each other, estimating, appreciating,
<em class="e000I2">valuing</em> one another, and exhibiting simply the result of that Valuation—or
<em class="e00S02">Value</em>.</p>

<p>There is, however, one of our wants, very special in its nature,
the cement of society, at once the cause and the effect of all our
transactions, and the everlasting problem of Political Economy, of
which it is necessary to say something in this place—I allude to
the want of <em class="e000I2">Exchanging</em>.</p>

<p>In the preceding chapter we have described the marvellous
effects of Exchange. They are such that men must naturally
feel a desire to facilitate it, even at the expense of considerable
sacrifices. It is for this end that we have roads, canals, railways,
carriages, ships, merchants, tradesmen, bankers; and it
is impossible to believe that society would submit to such
enormous draughts upon its forces for the purpose of facilitating
<a id="p151" class="xxpn">[p151]</a> exchange, if it did not find in exchange itself an ample compensation.</p>

<p>We have also seen that direct <em class="e000I2">barter</em> could give rise only to
transactions at once inconvenient and restrained.</p>

<p>It is on that account that men have thought of resolving barter
into two factors, <em class="e000I2">sale</em> and <em class="e000I2">purchase</em>, by means of an intermediate
commodity, readily divisible, and, above all, possessed of <em class="e000I2">value</em>,
in order to secure public confidence. This intermediate commodity
is Money.</p>

<p>And it is worthy of remark that what, by an ellipsis or metonymy,
we designate the value of gold and silver rests on exactly
the same foundation as that of the air, the water, the diamond, the
sermons of our old missionary, or the roulades of Malibran—that
is to say, upon services rendered and received.</p>

<p>The gold, indeed, which we find spread on the favoured banks of
the Sacramento, derives from nature many precious qualities—ductility,
weight, beauty, brilliancy, utility even, if you will. But
there is one quality which nature has not given it, because nature
has nothing to do with that—<em class="e000I2">Value</em>. A man knows that gold supplies
a want which is sensibly felt, and that it is much coveted.
He goes to California to seek for gold, just as my neighbour went
to the spring to fetch water. He devotes himself to hard work—he
digs, he excavates, he washes, he melts down—and then he comes
to me and says: I will render you the service of transferring to
you this gold; what service will you render me in return? We
discuss the matter, we weigh all the circumstances which should
influence our determination;—at last we conclude a bargain, and
Value is manifested and fixed. Misled by this curt form of expression,
“Gold is <em class="e000I2">valuable</em>,” we might suppose that the value
resides in the gold, just as the qualities of ductility and specific
gravity reside in it, and that nature has put it there. I hope the
reader is already satisfied that this is a mistake. By-and-by he
will be convinced that it is a deplorable fallacy.</p>

<p>Another misconception exists on the subject of gold, or rather
of money. As it is the constant medium which enters into all
transactions, the mean term between the two factors of <em class="e000I2">compound
barter</em>, it is always with its value that we compare the value of
the two services to be exchanged; and hence we are led to
regard gold or money as a <em class="e000I2">measure</em> of value. In practice it cannot
be otherwise. But science ought never to forget that money, so
far as its value is concerned, is subject to the same fluctuations as
any other product or service. Science does forget this sometimes;
nor is it surprising. Everything tends to make us consider money
<a id="p152" class="xxpn">[p152]</a> as the measure of value, in the same way as the <em class="e000I2">litre</em> (or quart) is
the measure of capacity. It plays an analogous part in actual
business. One is not aware of its own fluctuations, because the
franc, like its multiples and sub-multiples, always retains the
same denomination. And arithmetic itself tends to propagate the
confusion by ranking the franc as a measure, along with the measures
of quantity in daily use.</p>

<p>I have given a definition of Value, at least of value according to
my idea of it. I have subjected that definition to the test of
divers facts. None of them, so far as I can see, contradict it; and
the scientific signification which I have given to the word agrees
with its vulgar acceptation, which is no small advantage, no slight
guarantee—for what is science but experience classified? What
is theory but the methodical exposition of universal practice?</p>

<p>I may now be permitted to glance rapidly at the systems which
have hitherto prevailed. It is not in a spirit of controversy, much
less of criticism, that I enter upon this examination, and I should
willingly avoid it were I not convinced that it will throw new
light upon the fundamental principles which I am advocating.</p>

<p>We have seen that writers on Political Economy have sought
for the principle of Value in one or more of the accidents which
exercise a notable influence over it, such as materiality, conservability,
utility, rarity, labour, etc.; just like a physiologist who
should seek the principle of life in one or more of the external
phenomena which are necessary to its development, as air, water,
light, electricity, etc.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Materiality.</em>—“Man,” says M. de Bonald, “is mind served by
organs.” If the economists of the materialist school had simply
meant that men can render reciprocal services to each other only
through the medium of their bodily organs, and had thence concluded
that there is always something material in these services,
and, consequently, in Value, I should not have proceeded a step
farther, as I have a horror at word-catching and subtilties, which
wit revels in.</p>

<p>But they have not thus understood it. What they believe is
that Value has been communicated to matter, either by the labour
of man or by the action of nature. In a word, deceived by the
elliptical form of expression, gold <em class="e000I2">is worth</em> so much, corn <em class="e000I2">is worth</em>
so much, they think they see in matter a quality called <em class="e000I2">Value</em>,
just as the natural philosopher sees in it resistance and weight—and
yet these attributes have been disputed.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, I dispute formally the existence of Value as
an attribute of matter. <a id="p153" class="xxpn">[p153]</a></p>

<p>And first of all, it cannot be denied that Matter and Value are
often found separated. When we say to a man—Carry that
letter to its destination—fetch me some water—teach me this
science or that manufacturing process—give me advice as to my
sickness, or my law-suit—watch over my security, while I give
myself up to labour or to sleep,—what we demand is a Service,
and in that service we acknowledge in the face of the world that
there resides a <em class="e000I2">Value</em>, seeing that we pay for it voluntarily by an
<em class="e000I2">equivalent</em> service. It would be strange that we should refuse to
admit in theory what universal consent admits in practice.</p>

<p>True, our transactions have reference frequently to material
objects; but what does that prove? Why, that men, by exercising
foresight, prepare to render services which they know to be
in demand. I purchase a coat ready made, or I have a tailor to
come to my house to work by the day; but does that change the
principle of Value, so as to make it reside at one time in the coat
and at another time in the service?</p>

<p>One might ask here this puzzling question—Must we not see
the principle of Value first of all in the material object, and then
attribute it by analogy to the services? I say that it is just the
reverse. We must recognise it first of all in the services, and
attribute it afterwards, if we choose, by a figure of speech, by
metonymy, to the material objects.</p>

<p>The numerous examples which I have adduced render it unnecessary
for me to pursue this discussion further. But I cannot
refrain from justifying myself for having entered on it, by showing
to what fatal consequences an error, or, if you will, an incomplete
truth, may lead, when placed at the threshold of a science.</p>

<p>The least inconvenience of the definition which I am combating
has been to curtail and mutilate Political Economy. If Value
resides in matter, then where there is no matter there can be no
Value. The <em class="e000I2">Physiocrates</em><a
href="#FN_31" id="FNa_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> designated three-fourths of the entire
population as <em class="e000I2">sterile</em>, and Adam Smith, softening the expression,
as <em class="e000I2">unproductive</em> classes.</p>

<p>But as facts in the long run are stronger than definitions, it
became necessary in some way to bring back these classes, and
make them re-enter the circle of economic studies. They were
introduced by way of analogy; but the language of the science,
formed beforehand on other definitions, had been so materialized
as to render this extension repulsive. What mean such phrases
as these: “To consume an immaterial product? Man is accumulated
capital? Security is a commodity?” etc., etc. <a id="p154" class="xxpn">[p154]</a></p>

<p>Not only was the language of the science materialized beyond
measure, but writers were forced to surcharge it with subtile distinctions,
in order to reconcile ideas which had been erroneously
separated. Hence Adam Smith’s expression of <em class="e000I2">Value in use</em>, in
contradistinction to <em class="e000I2">Value in exchange</em>, etc.</p>

<p>A greater evil still has been that, in consequence of this confusion
of two great social phenomena, <em class="e000I2">property</em> and <em class="e000I2">community</em>, the
one has seemed incapable of justification, and the other has been
lost sight of.</p>

<p>In fact, if Value resides in matter, it becomes mixed up with
the physical qualities of bodies which render them useful to man.
Now, these qualities are frequently placed there by nature. Then
nature co-operates in creating <em class="e000I2">Value</em>, and we find ourselves attributing
value to what is essentially <em class="e000I2">common</em> and <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>. On
what basis, then, do you place <em class="e000I2">property</em>? When the remuneration
which I give in order to obtain a material product, corn for example,
is distributed among all the labourers, near or at a distance,
who have rendered me a <em class="e000I2">service</em> in the production of that
commodity,—who is to receive that portion of the <em class="e000I2">value</em> which corresponds
to the action of nature, and with which man has nothing
to do? Is it Providence who is to receive it? No one will say
so, for we never heard of Nature demanding wages. Is man to
receive it? What title has he to it, seeing that, by the hypothesis,
he has done nothing?</p>

<p>Do not suppose that I am exaggerating, and that, for the sake of
my own definition, I am torturing the definition of the economists,
and deducing from it too rigorous conclusions. No, these consequences
they have themselves very explicitly deduced, under the
pressure of logic.</p>

<p>Thus, Senior has said that “those who have appropriated natural
agents receive, under the form of rent, a recompense without
having made any sacrifice. They merely hold out their
hands to receive the offerings of the rest of the community.”
Scrope tells us that “landed property is an artificial restriction
imposed upon the enjoyment of those gifts which the Creator has
intended for the satisfaction of the wants of all.” J. B. Say has
these words: “Arable lands <em class="e000I2">would seem</em> to form a portion of
natural wealth, seeing that they are not of human creation, and
that nature has given them to man <em class="e000I2">gratuitously</em>. But as this description
of wealth is not fugitive, like air and water,—as a field
is a space fixed and marked out which <em class="e000I2">certain</em> men have succeeded
in appropriating, to the exclusion of all others who have
given their consent to this appropriation, land, which was natural
<a id="p155" class="xxpn">[p155]</a> and <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> property, has now <em class="e000I2">become</em> social wealth, the use of
which must be paid for.”</p>

<p>Truly, if it be so, Proudhon is justified in proposing this terrible
question, followed by an affirmation still more terrible:—</p>

<p>“To whom belongs the rent of land? To the producer of
land, without doubt. Who made the land? God. Then, proprietor,
begone!”</p>

<p>Yes, by a vicious definition, Political Economy has handed
over logic to the Communists. I will break this terrible weapon
in their hands, or rather they shall surrender it to me cheerfully.
The consequences will disappear when I have annihilated the
principle. And I undertake to demonstrate that if, in the production
of wealth, the action of nature is combined with the
action of man, the first—gratuitous and common in its own nature—remains
gratuitous and common in all our transactions;
that the second alone represents <em class="e000I2">services</em>, <em class="e000I2">value</em>; that the action of
man alone is remunerated; and that it alone is the foundation,
explanation, and justification of Property. In a word, I maintain
that, relatively to each other, men are proprietors only of the value
of things, and that in transferring products from hand to hand, what
they stipulate for exclusively is value, that is to say, reciprocal services:—all
the qualities, properties, and utilities, which these products
derive from nature being obtained by them into the bargain.</p>

<p>If Political Economy hitherto, in disregarding this fundamental
consideration, has shaken the guardian principle of property, by
representing it as an artificial institution, necessary, indeed, but
unjust, she has by the same act left in the shade, and completely
unperceived, another admirable phenomenon the most
touching dispensation of Providence to the creature—the phenomenon
of <em class="e000I2">progressive community</em>.</p>

<p>Wealth, taking the word in its general acceptation, results from
the combination of two agencies—the action of nature, and the
action of man. The first is <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> and <em class="e000I2">common</em> by the destination
of Providence, and never loses that character. The second
alone is <em class="e000I2">provided with value</em>, and, consequently, <em class="e000I2">appropriated</em>. But
with the development of intelligence, and the progress of civilisation,
the one takes a greater and greater part, the other a less and
less part, in the realization of each given utility; whence it follows
that the domain of the Gratuitous and the Common is continually
expanding among men relatively to the domain of Value
and Property; a consoling and suggestive view of the subject,
entirely hidden from the eye of science, so long as we continue to
attribute Value to the co-operation of nature. <a id="p156" class="xxpn">[p156]</a></p>

<p>Men of all religions thank God for His benefits. The father of
a family blesses the bread which he breaks and distributes to his
children—a touching custom, that reason would not justify
were the liberality of Providence other than gratuitous.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Durableness</em>, <em class="e000I2">conservability</em>—that pretended <em class="e000I2">sine quâ non</em> of
Value, is connected with the subject which I have just been discussing.
It is necessary to the very existence of value, as Adam
Smith thinks, that it should be fixed and realized in something
which can be exchanged, accumulated, preserved, consequently in
something <em class="e000I2">material</em>.</p>

<p>“There is one sort of labour which adds<a
href="#FN_32" id="FNa_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> to the value of the
subject upon which it is bestowed. There is another which has
no such effect.”</p>

<p>“The labour of the manufacturer,” he adds, “fixes and realizes
itself in some particular subject or vendible commodity, <em class="e000I2">which lasts
for some time at least</em> after the labour is past. The labour of the
menial servant, on the contrary” (to which the author assimilates
in this respect that of soldiers, magistrates, musicians, professors,
etc.), “does not fix or realize itself in any particular
subject or vendible commodity. His services perish in the very
instant of their performance, and leave no trace of <em class="e000I2">value</em> behind
them.”</p>

<p>Here we find <em class="e000I2">Value</em> connected rather with the modifications of
matter than with the satisfactions of men—a profound error; for
the sole good to be obtained from the modification of material
things is the attainment of that satisfaction which is the design,
the end, the <em class="e000I2">consommation</em><a
href="#FN_33" id="FNa_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> of every Effort. If, then, we realize
that satisfaction by a direct and immediate effort, the result is the
same; and if that effort can be made the subject of transactions,
exchanges, <em class="e000I2">estimation</em>, it includes the principle of <em class="e000I2">Value</em>.</p>

<p>As regards the interval which may elapse between the effort
and the satisfaction, surely Adam Smith attributes far too much
importance to it, when he says that the existence or non-existence
of Value depends upon it. “The value of a vendible commodity,”
he says, “<em class="e000I2">lasts for some time at least</em>.” Undoubtedly it lasts until
the commodity has answered its purpose, which is to satisfy a
want; and exactly the same thing may be said of a service. As
long as that plate of strawberries remains on the sideboard it
preserves its <em class="e000I2">value</em>. Why? Because it is the result of a service
<a id="p157" class="xxpn">[p157]</a> which I have designed to render to myself, or that another has
rendered to me by way of compensation, and <em class="e000I2">of which I have not
yet made use</em>. The moment I have made use of it, by eating the
strawberries, the value will disappear. <em class="e000I2">The service will vanish and
have no trace of value behind.</em> The very same thing holds of personal
services. The consumer makes the value disappear, for it
has been created only for that purpose. It is of little consequence,
as regards the principle of value, whether the service is undertaken
to satisfy a want to-day, to-morrow, or a year hence.</p>

<p>Take another case. I am afflicted with a cataract. I call in an
oculist. The instrument he makes use of has <em class="e000I2">value</em>, because it
has durability; the operation he performs, it is said, has none, and
yet I pay for it, and I have made choice of one among many rival
operators, and arranged his remuneration beforehand. To maintain
that this service has no value is to run counter to notorious
facts and notions universally received. And of what use, I would
ask, is a theory which, far from taking universal practice into
account, ignores it altogether?</p>

<p>I would not have the reader suppose that I am carried away by
an inordinate love of controversy. If I dwell upon these elementary
notions, it is to prepare his mind for consequences of the
highest importance, which will be afterwards developed. I know
not whether it be to violate the laws of method to indicate these
consequences by anticipation, but I venture to depart slightly
from the regular course, in order to obviate the danger of becoming
tedious. This is the reason why I have spoken prematurely
of Property and Community; and for the same reason I shall
here say a word respecting <em class="e000I2">Capital</em>.</p>

<p>As Adam Smith made value to reside in matter, he could not
conceive Capital as existing otherwise than in an accumulation of
material objects. How, then, can we attribute Value to Services
not susceptible of being accumulated or converted into capital?</p>

<p>Among the different descriptions of Capital, we give the first
place to tools, machines, instruments of labour. They serve to
make natural forces co-operate in the work of production, and,
attributing to these forces the faculty of creating value, people
were led to imagine that instruments of labour, as such, were
endowed with the same faculty, independently of any human services.
Thus the spade, the plough, the steam-engine, were supposed
to co-operate simultaneously with natural agents and human
forces in creating not only Utility, but Value also. But all value
is remunerated by exchange. Who, then, is to receive that portion
of value which is independent of all human service? <a id="p158" class="xxpn">[p158]</a></p>

<p>It is thus that the school of Proudhon, after having brought the
<em class="e000I2">rent of land</em> into question, has contested also the <em class="e000I2">interest of capital</em>—a
larger thesis, because it includes the other. I maintain that
the Proudhonian error, viewed scientifically, has its root in the
prior error of Adam Smith. I shall demonstrate that capital,
like natural agents, considered in itself, and with reference to its
own proper action, creates utility, but never creates value. The
latter is essentially the fruit of a legitimate <em class="e000I2">service</em>. I shall demonstrate
also that, in the social order, capital is not an accumulation
of material objects, depending on material durability, but
an accumulation of <em class="e000I2">Values</em>, that is to say, of <em class="e000I2">services</em>. This will
put an end (virtually at least, by removing its foundation) to the
recent attack upon the productiveness of capital, and in a way
satisfactory to the objectors themselves; for if I prove that there
is nothing in the business of exchange but a <em class="e000I2">mutuality of services</em>,
M. Proudhon must own himself vanquished by my victory over
his principle.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Labour.</em>—Adam Smith and his disciples have assigned the principle
of Value to Labour under the condition of Materiality.
This is contrary to the other opinion that natural forces play a
certain part in the production of Value. I have not here to combat
the contradictions which become apparent in all their fatal
consequences when these authors come to discuss the rent of land
and the interest of capital.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, when they refer the principle of Value to
Labour, they would be very near the truth if they did not allude
to manual labour. I have said, in fact, at the beginning of this
chapter, that Value must have reference to <em class="e000I2">Effort</em>,—an expression
which I prefer to the word Labour, as more general, and embracing
the whole sphere of human activity. But I hasten to add that it
can spring only from efforts exchanged—from reciprocal Services;
because value is not a thing having independent existence, but a
relation.</p>

<p>There are then, strictly speaking, two flaws in Adam Smith’s
definition. The first is, that it does not take exchange into account,
without which value can be neither produced nor conceived.
The second is, that it makes use of too restricted a term—<em class="e000I2">labour</em>;
unless we give to that term an unusual extension, and include in it
the ideas not only of intensity and duration, but of skill, sagacity,
and even of good or bad fortune.</p>

<p>The word <em class="e000I2">service</em>, which I substitute in my definition, removes
these defects. It implies, necessarily, the idea of transmission, for
no service can be rendered which is not received; and it implies
<a id="p159" class="xxpn">[p159]</a> also the idea of Effort, without taking for granted that the value is
proportionate.</p>

<p>It is in this, above all, that the definition of the English Economists
is vicious. To say that Value resides in Labour induces us
to suppose that Value and Labour are proportional, and serve as
reciprocal measures of each other. This is contrary to fact, and a
definition which is contrary to fact must be defective.</p>

<p>It often happens that an exertion, considered insignificant in
itself, passes with the world as of enormous <em class="e000I2">value</em>. (Take, for
example, the diamond, the performance of the prima donna, a
dash of a banker’s pen, a fortunate privateering adventure, a
touch of Raphael’s pencil, a bull of plenary indulgence, the easy
duty of an English queen, etc.) It still more frequently happens
that laborious and overwhelming labour tends to what is absolutely
<em class="e000I2">valueless</em>; and if it be so, how can we establish co-relation and proportion
between <em class="e000I2">Value</em> and <em class="e000I2">Labour</em>?</p>

<p>My definition removes the difficulty. It is clear that in certain
circumstances one can render a great service at the expense of a
very small exertion, and that in others, after great exertion, we
render no service at all. And this is another reason why, in
this respect, it is correct to say that the Value is in the Service
rendered, rather than in the Labour bestowed, seeing that it bears
proportion to the one and not to the other.</p>

<p>I go further. I affirm that value is estimated as much by the
labour saved to the recipient as by the labour performed by the
<em class="e000I2">cédant</em> [the man who cedes or makes it over]. Let the reader
recall the dialogue which we supposed to take place between the
two parties who bargained for the diamond. In substance, it has
reference to no accidental circumstances, but enters, tacitly, into
the essence and foundation of all transactions. Keep in mind that
we here take for granted that the two parties are at entire liberty
to exercise their own will and judgment. Each of them, in making
the exchange, is determined by various considerations, among
which we must certainly rank, as of the greatest importance, the
difficulty experienced by the recipient in procuring for himself, by
a direct exertion, the satisfaction which is offered to him. Both
parties have their eyes on that difficulty, the one with the view of
being more yielding, the other with the view of being more exacting.
The labour undergone by the <em class="e000I2">cédant</em> also exerts an influence
on the bargain. It is one of the elements of it, but it is not the
only one. It is not, then, exact to say that value is determined
by labour. It is determined by a multitude of considerations, all
comprised in the word <em class="e000I2">service</em>. <a id="p160" class="xxpn">[p160]</a></p>

<p>What may be affirmed with great truth is this; that, in consequence
of competition, Value <em class="e000I2">tends</em> to become more proportioned to
Effort—recompense to merit. It is one of the beautiful Harmonies
of the social state. But, as regards Value, this equalizing pressure
exercised by competition is quite external, and it is not allowable
in strict logic to confound the influence which a phenomenon
undergoes, from an external cause, with the phenomenon itself.<a
href="#FN_34" id="FNa_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Utility.</em>—J. B. Say, if I am not mistaken, was the first who
threw off the yoke of <em class="e000I2">materiality</em>. He made out value very expressly
<a id="p161" class="xxpn">[p161]</a> to be a <em class="e000I2">moral quality</em>,—an expression which perhaps goes
too far, for value can scarcely be said to be either a physical or a
moral quality—it is simply a relation.</p>

<p>But the great French Economist has himself said, that “It is
not given to any one to reach the confines of science, and Philosophers
mount on each other’s shoulders to explore a more and
more extended horizon.” Perhaps the glory of M. Say (in what
regards the special question with which we are now occupied, for
his titles to glory in other respects are as numerous as they are
imperishable) is to have bequeathed to his successors a view of the
subject which is prolific and suggestive.</p>

<p>M. Say’s principle was this—“<em class="e000I2">Value is founded on Utility.</em>”</p>

<p>If we had here to do with utility as connected with human
<em class="e000I2">services</em>, I should not contest this principle. At most I could
only observe that it is superfluous, as being self-evident. It is
very clear, as matter of fact, that no one consents to remunerate a
<em class="e000I2">service</em>, unless right or wrong, he judges it to be useful. The
word service includes the idea of <em class="e000I2">utility</em>—so much so that it is
nothing else than a literal reproduction of the Latin word <em class="e000I2">uti</em>; in
French, <em class="e000I2">servir</em>.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately, it is not in this sense that Say understands
it. He discovers the principle of value not only in human services,
rendered by means of material things, but in the <em class="e000I2">useful</em>
qualities put by nature into the things themselves. In this way
he places himself once more under the yoke of materiality, and is
very far, we are obliged to confess, from clearing away the mist
in which the English Economists had enveloped the question of
Property.</p>

<p>Before discussing Say’s principle on its own merits, I must
explain its logical bearing, in order to avoid the reproach of
landing myself and the reader in an idle discussion.</p>

<p>We cannot doubt that the Utility of which Say speaks is that
which resides in material objects. If corn, timber, coal, broad
cloth, have value, it is because these products possess qualities
which render them proper for our use, fit to satisfy the want we
experience of food, fuel, and clothing.</p>

<p>Hence, as nature has created Utility, it is inferred that she has
created also Value—a fatal confusion of ideas, out of which the
enemies of property have forged a terrible weapon.</p>

<p>Take a commodity, corn for example. I purchase it at the
<em class="e000I2">Halle au Blé</em> for sixteen francs. A great portion of these sixteen
francs is distributed—in infinite ramifications, and an inextricable
complication of advances and reimbursements—among all the men,
<a id="p162" class="xxpn">[p162]</a> here or abroad, who have co-operated in furnishing this corn.
Part goes to the labourer, the sower, the reaper, the thrasher,
the carter,—part to the blacksmith and plough-wright, who have
prepared the agricultural implements. Thus far all are agreed,
whether Economists or Communists.</p>

<p>But I perceive that four out of the sixteen francs go to the
proprietor of the soil, and I have a good right to ask if that man,
like the others, has rendered me a Service to entitle him incontestably,
like them, to remuneration.</p>

<p>According to the doctrine which the present work aspires to
establish, the answer is categorical. It consists of a peremptory
<em class="e000I2">yes</em>. The proprietor <em class="e000I2">has</em> rendered me a service. What is it?
This, that he has by himself, or his ancestor, cleared and enclosed
the field—he has cleared it of weeds and stagnant water—he has
enriched and thickened the vegetable mould—he has built a house
and a homestead. All this presupposes much labour executed by
him in person; or, what comes to the same thing, by others whom
he has paid. These are services, certainly, which, according to
the just law of reciprocity, must be reimbursed to him. Now, this
proprietor has never been remunerated, at least to the full extent.
He cannot be so by the first man who comes to buy from him a
bag of corn. What is the arrangement, then, that takes place?
Assuredly the most ingenious, the most legitimate, the most
equitable arrangement which it is possible to imagine. It consists
in this—That whoever wishes to purchase a sack of corn
shall pay, besides the services of the various labourers whom we
have enumerated, a small portion of the <em class="e000I2">services</em> rendered by the
proprietor. In other words, the <em class="e000I2">Value</em> of the proprietor’s <em class="e000I2">services</em>
is spread over all the sacks of corn which are produced by this
field.</p>

<p>Now, it may be asked if the supposed remuneration of four francs
be too great or too small. I answer that Political Economy has
nothing to do with that. That science establishes that the value
of the services rendered by the landed proprietor are regulated by
exactly the same laws as the value of other services, and that is
enough.</p>

<p>It may be a subject of surprise, too, that this bit-by-bit reimbursement
should not at length amount to a complete liquidation,
and, consequently, to an extinction of the proprietor’s claim.
They who make this objection do not reflect that it is of the
nature of Capital to produce a perpetual return, as we shall see
in the sequel.</p>

<p>I shall not dwell longer on that question in this place; and shall
<a id="p163" class="xxpn">[p163]</a> simply remark, that there is not in the entire price of the corn a
single farthing which does not go to remunerate human services,—not
one which corresponds to the <em class="e000I2">value</em> that nature is supposed to
have given to the corn by imparting to it <em class="e000I2">utility</em>.</p>

<p>But if, adhering to the principle of Say and the English Economists,
you assert that, of the sixteen francs, there are twelve which
go to the labourers, sowers, reapers, carters, etc.—two which recompense
the personal services of the proprietor; and finally, that
there are two others which represent a value which has for its
foundation the <em class="e000I2">utility</em> created by God, by natural agents, and
without any co-operation of man, do you not perceive that you
immediately lay yourself open to be asked, Who is to profit by
this portion of <em class="e000I2">value</em>? Who has a title to this remuneration?
Nature does not demand it, and who dare take nature’s place.</p>

<p>The more Say tries to explain Property on this hypothesis, the
more he exposes himself to attack. He sets out by justly comparing
nature to a laboratory, in which various chemical operations
take place, the result of which is useful to man. “The soil,
then,” he adds, “is the <em class="e000I2">producer of utility</em>, and when <em class="e0U003">IT</em> (the soil)
receives payment in the form of a profit or a rent <em class="e000I2">to its proprietor</em>,
it is not without giving something to the consumer in exchange
for what he pays <em class="e0U003">IT</em> (the soil). <em class="e00S02">It</em> (still the soil) gives him the
utility it has produced, and it is in producing this utility that <em class="e000I2">the
earth is productive as well as labour</em>.”</p>

<p>This assertion is unmistakable. Here we have two pretenders,
who present themselves to share the remuneration due by the
consumer of corn—namely, the earth and labour. They urge the
same title, for the soil, M. Say affirms, is productive as well as
labour. Labour asks to be remunerated for a <em class="e000I2">service</em>; the soil
demands to be remunerated for a <em class="e000I2">utility</em>, and this remuneration it
demands not for itself (for in what form should we give it?) but
for <em class="e000I2">its proprietor</em>.</p>

<p>Whereupon Proudhon summons the proprietor, who represents
himself as having the powers of the soil at his disposal, to exhibit
his title.</p>

<p>You wish me to pay; in other words, to render a service, in
order that I may receive the <em class="e000I2">utility</em> produced by natural agents,
independently of the assistance of man, already paid for separately.</p>

<p>But, I ask again, Who is to profit by my service?</p>

<p>Is it the producer of utility,—that is to say, the soil? That is
absurd—the fear of any demand from that quarter need give no
great uneasiness. <a id="p164" class="xxpn">[p164]</a></p>

<p>Is it man? but by what title does he demand it? If for having
rendered me a service, well and good. In that case, we are at one.
It is the human service which <em class="e000I2">has value</em>, not the natural service;
and that is just the conclusion to which I desire to bring you.</p>

<p>That, however, is contrary to your hypothesis. You say that
all the human services are remunerated with fourteen francs, and
that the two francs which make up the price of the corn correspond
to the value created by nature. In that case, I repeat my
question—By what title does any one present himself to receive
them? Is it not, unfortunately, too clear that if you give specially
the name of <em class="e000I2">proprietor</em> to the man who claims right to these two
francs, you justify the too famous saying that <em class="e000I2">Property is theft</em>?</p>

<p>And don’t imagine that this confusion between utility and value
shakes only the foundation of landed property. After having led
you to contest the <em class="e000I2">rent of land</em>, it leads you to contest also the
<em class="e000I2">interest of capital</em>.</p>

<p>In fact, machines, the instruments of labour, are, like the soil,
producers of <em class="e000I2">utility</em>. If that utility has <em class="e000I2">value</em>, it is paid for, for the
word value implies right to payment. But to whom is the payment
made? To the proprietor of the machine, without doubt. Is
it for a personal service? Then say at once that the value is in
the service. But if you say that it is necessary to make a payment
first for the service, and a second payment for the utility produced
by the machine independently of the human action, which has
been already recompensed, then I ask you to whom does this
second payment go, and how has the man who has been already
remunerated for all his services a right to demand anything more?</p>

<p>The truth is, that the utility which is produced by nature is
<em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>, and therefore <em class="e000I2">common</em>, like that produced by the instruments
of labour. It is gratuitous and common on one condition,
that we take the trouble, that we render ourselves the service of
appropriating it; or, if we give that trouble to or demand that
service from another, that we cede to him in return an <em class="e000I2">equivalent</em>
service. It is in these services, thus compared, that value resides,
and not at all in natural utility. The exertion may be more or
less great—that makes a difference in the value, not in the utility.
When we stand near a spring, water is gratuitous for us all on
condition that we stoop to lift it. If we ask our neighbour to take
that trouble for us, then a convention, a bargain, a <em class="e000I2">value</em> makes its
appearance, but that does not make the water otherwise than
gratuitous. If we are an hour’s walk from the spring, the basis of
the transaction will be different; but the difference is one of degree,
not of principle. The value has not, on that account, passed into
<a id="p165" class="xxpn">[p165]</a> the water or into its utility. The water continues still <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>
on condition of fetching it, or of remunerating those who, by a
bargain freely made and discussed, agree to spare us that exertion
by making it themselves.</p>

<p>It is the same thing in every case. We are surrounded by
utilities, but we must <em class="e000I2">stoop to appropriate them</em>. That exertion is
sometimes very simple, and often very complicated. Nothing is
more easy, in the general case, than to draw water, the utility of
which has been prepared by nature beforehand. It is not so easy
to obtain corn, the utility of which nature has equally prepared.
This is why these two efforts differ in degree though not in principle.
The service is more or less onerous; therefore more or less
<em class="e000I2">valuable</em>—the utility is, and remains always, <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>.</p>

<p>Suppose an instrument of labour to intervene, what would be
the result? That the utility would be more easily obtained. The
service has thus less <em class="e000I2">value</em>. We certainly pay less for our books
since the invention of printing. Admirable phenomenon, too little
understood! You say that the instruments of labour produce
Value—you are mistaken—it is Utility, and gratuitous Utility,
you should say. As to Value, instead of producing it, they tend
more and more to annihilate it.</p>

<p>It is quite true that the person who made the machine has
rendered a service. He receives a remuneration by which the
value of the product is augmented. This is the reason why we
fancy we recompense the utility which the machine produces. It
is an illusion. What we remunerate is the <em class="e000I2">services</em> which all those
who have co-operated in making and working the machine have
rendered to us. So little does the value reside in the utility produced,
that even after having recompensed these new <em class="e000I2">services</em>, we
acquire the utility on easier and cheaper terms than before.</p>

<p>Let us accustom ourselves to distinguish Utility from Value.
Without this there can be no Economic science. I give utterance
to no paradox when I affirm that Utility and Value, so far from
being identical, or oven similar, are ideas opposed to one another.
Want, Effort, Satisfaction: here we have man regarded in an
Economic point of view. The relation of utility is with Want
and Satisfaction. The relation of Value is with Effort. Utility
is the Good, which puts an end to the want by the satisfaction.
Value is the Evil, for it springs from the obstacle which is interposed
between the want and the satisfaction. But for these
obstacles, there would have been no Effort either to make or in
exchange; Utility would be infinite, gratuitous, and common,
<em class="e000I2">without condition</em>, and the notion of Value would never have
<a id="p166" class="xxpn">[p166]</a> entered into the world. In consequence of these obstacles, Utility
is gratuitous only on condition of Efforts exchanged, which, when
compared with each other, give rise to Value. The more these
obstacles give way before the liberality of nature and the progress
of science, the more does utility approximate to the state of being
absolutely common and gratuitous, for the onerous condition, and,
consequently, the <em class="e000I2">value</em>, diminish as the obstacles diminish. I
shall esteem myself fortunate if, by these dissertations, which
may appear subtle, and of which I am condemned to fear at once
the length and the conciseness, I succeed in establishing this
encouraging truth—<em class="e000I2">the legitimate property of value</em>,—and this other
truth, equally consoling—<em class="e000I2">the progressive community of utility</em>.</p>

<p>One observation more. All that <em class="e000I2">serves</em> us is <em class="e000I2">useful</em> (<em class="e000I2">uti</em>, <em class="e000I2">servir</em>),
and in this respect it is extremely doubtful whether there be anything
in the universe (whether in the shape of forces or materials)
which is not <em class="e000I2">useful</em> to man.</p>

<p>We may affirm at least, without fear of mistake, that a multitude
of things possess a utility which is unknown to us. Were the
moon placed either higher or lower than she is, it is very possible
that the inorganic kingdom, consequently the vegetable kingdom,
consequently also the animal kingdom, might be profoundly
modified. But for that star which shines in the firmament while
I write, it may be that the human race had not existed. Nature
has surrounded us with utilities. The quality of being <em class="e000I2">useful</em> we
recognise in many substances and phenomena;—in others, science
and experience reveal it to us every day,—in others, again, it may
exist in perfection, and yet we may remain for ever ignorant of it.</p>

<p>When these substances and phenomena exert upon us, but
<em class="e000I2">independently of us</em>, their useful action, we have no interest in comparing
the degree of their utility to mankind; and, what is more,
we have scarcely the means of making the comparison. We know
that oxygen and azote are useful to us, but we don’t try, and probably
we should try in vain, to determine in what proportion.
We have not here the elements of appreciation—the elements of
value. I should say as much of the salts, the gases, the forces
which abound in nature. When all these agents are moved and
combined so as to produce for us, but <em class="e000I2">without our co-operation</em>,
utility, that utility we enjoy without <em class="e000I2">estimating</em> its value. It is
when our co-operation comes into play, and, above all, when it
comes to be exchanged,—it is then, and then only, that Estimation
and Value make their appearance, in connexion not with the
utility of the substances or phenomena, of which we are often
ignorant, but with the co-operation itself. <a id="p167" class="xxpn">[p167]</a></p>

<p>This is my reason for saying that “Value is the appreciation of
services exchanged.” These services may be very complicated;
they may have exacted a multitude of operations recent or remote;
they may be transmitted from one generation or one hemisphere
to another generation or another hemisphere, embracing countless
contracting parties, necessitating credits, advances, various arrangements,
until a general balance is effected. But the principle of
<em class="e000I2">value</em> is always in the services, and not in the utility of which
these services are the vehicle,—utility which is gratuitous in its
nature and essence, and which passes from hand to hand, if I may
be allowed the expression, <em class="e000I2">into the bargain</em>.</p>

<p>After all, if you persist in seeing in Utility the foundation of
Value, I am very willing, but it must be distinctly understood
that it is not that utility which is in things and phenomena by the
dispensation of Providence or the power of art, but the utility of
human services compared and exchanged.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Rarity.</em>—According to Senior, of all the circumstances which
determine value, rarity is the most decisive. I have no objection
to make to that remark, if it is not that the form in which it is
made presupposes that value is inherent in things themselves—a
hypothesis the very appearance of which I shall always combat.
At bottom, the word <em class="e000I2">rarity</em>, as applied to the subject we are now
discussing, expresses in a concise manner this idea, that, <em class="e000I2">cæteris
paribus</em>, a service has more value in proportion as we have more
difficulty in rendering it to ourselves; and that, consequently, a
larger equivalent is exacted from us when we demand it from
another. Rarity is one of these difficulties. It is one <em class="e000I2">obstacle</em>
more to be surmounted. The greater it is, the greater remuneration
do we award to those who surmount it for us. Rarity gives
rise frequently to large remunerations, and this is my reason for
refusing to admit with the English Economists that Value is proportional
to Labour. We must take into account the parsimony
with which nature treats us in certain respects. The word <em class="e000I2">service</em>
embraces all these ideas and shades of ideas.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Judgment.</em>—Storch sees <em class="e000I2">value</em> in the judgment by which we
recognise it. Undoubtedly, whenever we have to do with <em class="e000I2">relation</em>,
it is necessary to compare and to <em class="e000I2">judge</em>. Nevertheless, the relation
is one thing and the judgment is another. When we compare the
height of two trees, their magnitude, and the difference of their
magnitude, are independent of our appreciation.</p>

<p>But in the determination of value, what is the relation of which
we have to form a judgment? It is the relation of two services
exchanged. The business is to discover what the services rendered
<a id="p168" class="xxpn">[p168]</a> <em class="e000I2">are worth</em> in relation to those received, in connexion with
acts or things exchanged, and taking all circumstances into account,—not
what intrinsic utility resides in these acts or things,
for this utility may, to some extent, be altogether independent of
human exertion, and, consequently, devoid of <em class="e000I2">value</em>.</p>

<p>Storch falls into the error which I am now combating when he
says,—</p>

<p>“Our judgment enables us to discover the relation which exists
between our wants and the utility of things. The determination
which our judgment forms upon the <em class="e000I2">utility of things</em> constitutes
their <em class="e000I2">value</em>.”</p>

<p>And, farther on, he says,—</p>

<p>“In order to create a value, we must have the conjunction of
these three circumstances:—1<em class="e000I2">st</em>, That man experiences or conceives
a want; 2<em class="e000I2">d</em>, That there exists something calculated to
satisfy that want; and, 3<em class="e000I2">d</em>, That a judgment is pronounced in
favour of the <em class="e000I2">utility of the thing</em>. Then the value of things is
their relative <em class="e000I2">utility</em>.”</p>

<p>During the day I experience the want of seeing clearly. There
exists one thing calculated to satisfy that want—namely, the light
of the sun. My judgment pronounces in favour of the utility of
that thing, and&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. it has no value. Why? Because I
enjoy it without calling for the services of any one.</p>

<p>At night I experience the same want. There exists one thing
capable of satisfying it very imperfectly, a wax candle. My judgment
pronounces in favour of the utility, but far inferior utility, of
that thing—and it <em class="e000I2">has value</em>. Why? Because the man who has
taken the trouble to make the candle will not give it to me except
upon condition of my rendering him an equivalent service.</p>

<p>What we have, then, to compare and to judge of, in order to
determine Value, is not the <em class="e000I2">relative utility</em> of things, but the relation
of two services.</p>

<p>On these terms, I do not reject Storch’s definition.</p>

<p>Permit me to recapitulate a little, in order to show clearly that
my definition contains all that is true in the definitions of my predecessors,
and eliminates everything in them which is erroneous
either through excess or defect.</p>

<p>The principle of Value, we have seen, resides in a human <em class="e000I2">service</em>,
and results from the appreciation of two services compared.</p>

<p>Value must have relation to Effort. <em class="e000I2">Service</em> implies a certain
Effort.</p>

<p>Value supposes a comparison of Efforts exchanged, at least exchangeable.
<em class="e000I2">Service</em> implies the terms to give and to receive. <a id="p169" class="xxpn">[p169]</a></p>

<p>Value is not, however, in fact proportional to the intensity of
the Efforts. <em class="e000I2">Service</em> does not necessarily imply that proportion.</p>

<p>A multitude of external circumstances influence value without
constituting value itself. The word <em class="e000I2">service</em> takes all these circumstances
in due measure into account.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Materiality.</em>—When the service consists in transferring a material
thing, nothing hinders us from saying, by metonymy, that it is
the thing which <em class="e000I2">has value</em>. But we must not forget that this is a
figure of speech, by which we attribute to things themselves the
value of the services which produced them.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Conservability.</em>—Without reference to the consideration of
materiality, value endures until the satisfaction is obtained, and
no longer. Whether the satisfaction follows the effort more or
less nearly—whether the service is personal or real, makes no
change in the nature of value.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Capability of Accumulation.</em>—In a social point of view, what is
accumulated by saving is not matter, but value or services.<a
href="#FN_35" id="FNa_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Utility.</em>—I admit, with M. Say, that Utility is the foundation of
Value, provided it is granted me that we have no concern with the
utility which resides in commodities, but with the relative utility
of services.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Labour.</em>—I admit, with Ricardo, that Labour is the foundation
of Value, provided, first of all, the word labour is taken in the
most general sense, and that you do not afterwards assert a proportionality
which is contrary to fact; in other words, provided
you substitute for the word <em class="e000I2">labour</em> the word <em class="e000I2">service</em>.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Rarity.</em>—I admit, with Senior, that rarity influences <em class="e000I2">value</em>. But
why? Because it renders the <em class="e000I2">service</em> so much more precious.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Judgment.</em>—I admit, with Storch, that value results from a
judgment formed, provided it is granted me that the judgment
so formed is not upon the utility of things, but on the utility of
<em class="e000I2">services</em>.</p>

<p>Thus I hope to satisfy Economists of all shades of opinion. I
<a id="p170" class="xxpn">[p170]</a> admit them all to be right, because all have had a glimpse of the
truth in one of its aspects. Error is no doubt on the reverse of
the medal; and it is for the reader to decide whether my definition
includes all that is true, and rejects all that is false.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude without saying a word on that <em class="e000I2">quadrature</em> of
Political Economy—<em class="e000I2">the measure of value</em>; and here I shall repeat,
and with still more force, the observation with which I terminated
the preceding chapters.</p>

<p>I said that our wants, our desires, our tastes, have neither limit
nor exact measure.</p>

<p>I said also that our means of providing for our wants—the gifts
of nature, our faculties, activity, discernment, foresight—had no
precise measure. Each of these elements is variable in itself—it
differs in different men—it varies from hour to hour in the same
individual,—so that the whole forms an aggregate which is mobility
itself.</p>

<p>If, again, we consider what the circumstances are which influence
value—utility, labour, rarity, judgment—and reflect that there is
not one of these circumstances which does not vary <em class="e000I2">ad infinitum</em>,
we may well ask why men should set themselves so pertinaciously
to try to discover a fixed measure of Value?</p>

<p>It would be singular, indeed, if we were to find fixity in a mean
term composed of variable elements, and which is nothing else than
a Relation between two extreme terms more variable still!</p>

<p>The Economists, then, who go in pursuit of an <em class="e000I2">absolute measure
of value</em> are pursuing a chimera; and, what is more, a thing which,
if found, would be positively useless. Universal practice has
adopted gold and silver as standards, although practical men are
not ignorant how variable is the value of these metals. But of
what importance is the variability of the measure, if, affecting
equally and in the same manner the two objects which are exchanged,
it does not interfere with the fairness and equity of the
exchange? It is a <em class="e000I2">mean proportional</em>, which may rise or fall, without,
on that account, failing to perform its office, which is to show
the <em class="e000I2">Relation</em> of two extremes.</p>

<p>The design of the science is not, like that of exchange, to discover
the <em class="e000I2">present Relation of two services</em>, for, in that case, money
would answer the purpose in view. What the science aims at
discovering is <em class="e000I2">the Relation between Effort and Satisfaction</em>; and for
this purpose, a measure of value, did it exist, would teach us
nothing, for the effort brings always to the satisfaction a varying
proportion of gratuitous utility which has no value. It is because
this element of our well-being has been lost sight of that the
<a id="p171" class="xxpn">[p171]</a> majority of writers have deplored the absence of a measure of
Value. They have not reflected that it would not enable them to
answer the question proposed—What is the comparative Wealth
or prosperity of two classes, of two countries, of two generations?</p>

<p>In order to resolve that question, the science would require a
measure which should reveal to it not only <em class="e000I2">the relation of two
services</em>, which might be the vehicle of very different amounts of
gratuitous utility, but the relation <em class="e000I2">of the Effort to the Satisfaction</em>,
and that measure could be no other than the effort itself, or labour.</p>

<p>But how can labour serve as a measure? Is it not itself a most
variable element? Is it not more or less skilful, laborious, precarious,
dangerous, repugnant? Does it not require, more or less,
the intervention of certain intellectual faculties, of certain moral
virtues? and, according as it is influenced by these circumstances,
is it not rewarded by a remuneration which is in the highest degree
variable?</p>

<p>There is one species of labour which, at all times, and in all
places, is identically the same, and it is that which must serve as
a type. I mean labour the most simple, rude, primitive, muscular,—that
which is freest from all natural co-operation—that which
every man can execute—that which renders services of a kind
which one can render to himself—that which exacts no exceptional
force or skill, and requires no apprenticeship,—industry such as
is found in the very earliest stages of society: the work, in short,
of the simple day-labourer. That kind of labour is everywhere the
most abundantly supplied, the least special, the most homogeneous,
and the worst remunerated. Wages in all other departments are
proportioned and graduated on this basis, and increase with every
circumstance which adds to its importance.</p>

<p>If, then, we wish to compare two social states with each other,
we cannot have recourse to a <em class="e000I2">standard of value</em>, and for two reasons,
the one as logical as the other—first, because there is none; and,
secondly, because, if there were, it would give a wrong answer to
our question, neglecting, as it must, a considerable and progressive
element in human prosperity—gratuitous utility.</p>

<p>What we must do, on the contrary, is to put Value altogether
out of sight, particularly the consideration of money; and ask the
question, What, in such and such a country, and, at such and such
an epoch, is the amount of each kind of special utility, and the
sum total of all utilities, which correspond to a given amount of
unskilled labour? In other words, what amount of material comfort
and prosperity can an unskilled workman earn as the reward
of his daily toil? <a id="p172" class="xxpn">[p172]</a></p>

<p>We may affirm that the natural social order is harmonious, and
goes on improving, if, on the one hand, the number of unskilled
labours, receiving the smallest possible remuneration, continues
to diminish; and if, on the other, that remuneration, measured not
in value or in money, but in real satisfactions, continues constantly
on the increase.<a
href="#FN_36" id="FNa_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>The ancients have well described all the combinations of
Exchange:—</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Do ut des</em> (commodity against commodity), <em class="e000I2">Do ut facias</em> (commodity
against service), <em class="e000I2">Facio ut des</em> (service against commodity),
<em class="e000I2">Facio ut facias</em> (service against service).<a
href="#FN_37" id="FNa_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>Seeing that products and services are thus exchanged for one
another, it is quite necessary that they should have something in
common, something by which they can be compared and estimated—namely,
<em class="e000I2">Value</em>.</p>

<p>But value is always identically the same. Whether it be in
the product or in the service, it has always the same origin and
foundation.</p>

<p>This being so, we may ask, is Value originally and essentially
in the <em class="e000I2">commodity</em>, and is it only by analogy that we extend the
notion to the <em class="e000I2">service</em>?</p>

<p>Or, on the contrary, does Value reside in the service, and is it
not mixed up and amalgamated with the product, simply and exclusively
because the service is so?</p>

<p>Some people seem to think that this is a question of pure
subtilty. We shall see by-and-by. At present I shall only
observe, that it would be strange if, in Political Economy, a good
or a bad definition of Value were a matter of indifference.</p>

<p>I cannot doubt that, at the outset, Political Economists thought
they discovered value rather in the product, as such, than in the
matter of the product. The Physiocrates [the <em class="e000I2">Économistes</em> of
Quesnay’s school] attributed value exclusively to land, and stigmatized
as <em class="e000I2">sterile</em> such classes as added nothing to matter,—so
strictly in their eyes were <em class="e000I2">value</em> and <em class="e000I2">matter</em> bound up together.</p>

<p>Adam Smith ought to have discarded this idea, since he makes
<em class="e000I2">value</em> flow from <em class="e000I2">labour</em>. Do not pure services, services <em class="e000I2">per se</em>,
exact labour, and, consequently, do they not imply value? Near
to the truth as Smith had come, he did not make himself master
of it; for, besides pronouncing formally that labour, in order to
possess value, must be applied to matter, to something physically
<a id="p173" class="xxpn">[p173]</a> tangible and capable of accumulation, we know that, like the
Physiocrates, he ranked those who simply render services among
the unproductive classes.</p>

<p>These classes, in fact, occupy a prominent position in the
Wealth of Nations. But this only shows us that the author, after
having given a definition, found himself straitened by it, and, consequently,
that that definition is erroneous. Adam Smith would
not have gained his great and just renown had he not written his
magnificent chapters on Education, on the Clergy, and on Public
Services, and if he had, in treating of Wealth, confined himself
within the limits of his own definition. Happily, by this inconsistency,
he freed himself from the fetters which his premises
imposed upon him. This always happens. A man of genius who
sets out with a false principle never escapes inconsistency, without
which he would get deeper and deeper into error, and, far from
appearing a man of genius, would show himself no longer a man
of sense.</p>

<p>As Adam Smith advanced a step beyond the Physiocrates,
Jean Baptiste Say advanced a step beyond Smith. By degrees
Say was led to refer value to services, but only by way of analogy.
It is in the product that he discovers true value, and nothing shows
this better than his whimsical denomination of services as “immaterial
products”—two words which absolutely shriek out on
finding themselves side by side. Say, in the outset, agrees with
Smith; for the entire theory of the master is to be found in the
first ten lines of the work of the disciple.<a
href="#FN_38" id="FNa_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> But he thought and
meditated on the subject for thirty years, and he made progress.
He approximated more and more to the truth, without ever fully
attaining it.</p>

<p>Moreover, we might have imagined that Say did his duty as an
Economist as well by referring the value of the service to the
product, as by referring the value of the product to the service, if
the Socialist propaganda, founding on his own deductions, had not
come to reveal to us the insufficiency and the danger of his
principle.</p>

<p>The question I propose, then, is this:—Seeing that certain
products are possessed of value, seeing that certain services are
possessed of value, and seeing that value is one and identical, and
can have but one origin, one foundation, one explanation,—is this
origin, this explanation to be found in the product or in the
service?</p>

<p>The reply to that question is obvious, and for this unanswerable
<a id="p174" class="xxpn">[p174]</a> reason, that every product which has value implies service, but
every service does not necessarily imply a product.</p>

<p>This appears to me mathematically certain—conclusive.</p>

<p>A service, as such, has value, whether it assume a material form
or not.</p>

<p>A material object has value if, in transferring it to another, we
render him a service,—if not, it has no value.</p>

<p>Then value does not proceed from the material object to the
service, but from the service to the material object.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. Nothing is more easily explained than this
pre-eminence, this priority, given to the service over the product,
so far as value is concerned. We shall immediately see that this
is owing to a circumstance which might have been easily perceived,
but which has not been observed, just because it is under our eyes.
It is nothing else than that foresight which is natural to man, and
in virtue of which, in place of limiting himself to the services which
are demanded of him, he prepares himself beforehand to render
those services which he foresees are likely to be demanded. It
is thus that the <em class="e000I2">facio ut facias</em> transforms itself into the <em class="e000I2">do ut
des</em>, without its ceasing to be the dominant fact which explains
the whole transaction.</p>

<p>John says to Peter, I want a cup. I could make it for myself,
but if you will make it for me, you will render me a service, for
which I will pay you by an equivalent service.</p>

<p>Peter accepts the offer, and, in consequence, sets out in quest of
suitable materials, mixes them, manipulates them, and, in fine,
makes the article which John wants.</p>

<p>It is very evident that here it is the service which determines
the value. The dominant word in the transaction is <em class="e000I2">facio</em>. And
if, afterwards, the value is incorporated with the product, it is only
because it flows from the service, which combines the labour executed
by Peter with the labour saved to John.</p>

<p>Now, it may happen that John may make frequently the same
proposal to Peter, and that other people may also make it; so that
Peter can foresee with certainty the kind of services which will be
demanded of him, and prepare himself for rendering them. He
may say, I have acquired a certain degree of skill in making cups.
Experience tells me that cups supply a want which must be satisfied,
and I am therefore enabled to manufacture them beforehand.</p>

<p>Henceforth John says no longer to Peter, <em class="e000I2">facio ut facias</em>, but
<em class="e000I2">facio ut des</em>. If he in turn has foreseen the wants of Peter, and
laboured beforehand to provide for them, he can then say <em class="e000I2">do ut
des</em>. <a id="p175" class="xxpn">[p175]</a></p>

<p>But in what respect, I ask, does this progress, which flows from
human foresight, change the nature and origin of value? Does
service cease to be its foundation and measure? As regards the
true idea of value, what difference does it make whether Peter,
before he makes the cup, waits till there is a demand for it, or,
foreseeing a future demand, manufactures the article beforehand?</p>

<p>There is another remark which I would make here. In human
life, inexperience and thoughtlessness precede experience and foresight.
It is only in the course of time that men are enabled to
foresee each other’s wants, and to make preparations for satisfying
them. Logically, the <em class="e000I2">facio ut facias</em> must precede the <em class="e000I2">do ut des</em>.
The latter is at once the fruit and the evidence of a certain amount
of knowledge diffused, of experience acquired, of political security
obtained, of a certain confidence in the future,—in a word, of a
certain degree of civilisation. This social prescience, this faith in
a future <em class="e000I2">demand</em>, which causes us to provide a present <em class="e000I2">supply</em>;
this sort of intuitive acquaintance with statistics which each
possesses in a greater or less degree, and which establishes a surprising
equilibrium between our wants and the means of supplying
them, is one of the most powerful and efficacious promoters of
human improvement. To it we owe the division of labour, or at
least the separation of trades and professions. To it we owe one
of the advantages which men seek for with the greatest ardour,
the fixity of remuneration, under the form of <em class="e000I2">wages</em> as regards
labour, and <em class="e000I2">interest</em> as regards capital. To it we are indebted for
the institution of credit, transactions having reference to the
future, those which are designed to equalize risk, etc. It is surprising,
in an Economical point of view, that this noble attribute of
man, Foresight, has not been made more the subject of remark. This
arises, as Rousseau has said, from the difficulty we experience in
observing the medium in which we live and move, and which
forms our natural atmosphere. We notice only exceptional appearances
and abnormal facts, while we allow to pass unperceived
those which act permanently around us, upon us, and within us,
and which modify profoundly both individual men and society at
large.</p>

<p>To return to the subject which at present engages us. It may
be that human foresight, in its infinite diffusion, tends more and
more to substitute the <em class="e000I2">do ut des</em> for the <em class="e000I2">facio ut facias</em>; but we
must never forget that it is in the primitive and <em class="e000I2">necessary</em> form of
exchange that the notion of value first makes its appearance, that
this primitive form is that of reciprocal service; and that, after all,
<a id="p176" class="xxpn">[p176]</a> as regards exchange, the product is only a <em class="e000I2">service foreseen</em> and
provided for.</p>

<p>But although I have shown that value is not inherent in matter,
and cannot be classed among its attributes, I am far from maintaining
that it does not pass from the <em class="e000I2">service</em> to the <em class="e000I2">product</em>, so as
(if I may be allowed the expression) to become incorporated with
it. I hope my opponents will not believe that I am pedant
enough to wish to exclude from common language such phrase as
these—gold <em class="e000I2">has value</em>, wheat <em class="e000I2">has value</em>, land <em class="e000I2">has value</em>. But I
have a right to demand of science why this is so? and if I am
answered, because gold, wheat, and land possess in themselves
intrinsic <em class="e000I2">value</em>, then I think I have a right to say—“You are mistaken,
and your error is dangerous. You are mistaken, for there
are gold and land which are destitute of value, gold and land which
have not yet had any human labour bestowed upon them. Your
error is dangerous, for it leads men to regard what is simply a
right to a reciprocity of services as a usurpation of the gratuitous
gifts of God.”</p>

<p>I am quite willing, then, to acknowledge that products are
possessed of value, provided you grant me that it is not essential
to them, and that it attaches itself to services, and proceeds from
them.</p>

<p>This is so true, that a very important consequence, and one
which is fundamental in Political Economy, flows from it—a consequence
which has not been, and indeed could not be remarked.
It is this:—</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Where value has passed from the service to the product, it undergoes
in the product all the risks and chances to which it is subject in
the service itself.</em></p>

<p>It is not fixed in the product, as it would have been had it been
one of its own intrinsic qualities. It is essentially variable; it
may rise indefinitely, or it may fall until it disappears altogether,
just as the species of service to which it owes its origin would
have done.</p>

<p>The man who makes a cup to-day for the purpose of selling it a
year hence, confers value on it, and that value is determined by
that of the service—not the value which the service possesses at
the present moment, but that which it will possess at the end of
the year. If at the time when the cup comes to be sold such
services are more in demand, the cup will be worth more, or it
will be depreciated in the opposite case.</p>

<p>This is the reason why man is constantly stimulated to exercise
foresight, in order to turn it to account. He has always in
<a id="p177" class="xxpn">[p177]</a> perspective a possible rise or fall of value,—a recompense for just and
sagacious prevision, and chastisement when it is erroneous. And,
observe, his success or failure coincides with the public good or
the public detriment. If his foresight has been well directed, if
he has made preparations beforehand to give society the benefit of
services which are more in request, more appreciated, more efficacious,
which supply more adequately wants which are deeply
felt, he has contributed to diminish the scarcity, to augment the
abundance, of that description of service, and to bring it within
the reach of a greater number of persons at less expense. If, on
the other hand, he is mistaken in his calculations for the future,
he contributes, by his competition, to depress still farther those
services for which there is little demand. He only effects, and at
his own expense, a negative good,—he advertises the public that
a certain description of wants no longer call for the exertion of
much social activity, which activity must now take another
direction, or go without recompense.</p>

<p>This remarkable fact—that <em class="e000I2">value</em>, <em class="e000I2">incorporated</em> in a product,
depends on the value of the kind of service to which it owes its
origin—is of the very highest importance, not only because it
demonstrates more and more clearly the theory that the principle
of value resides in the service, but because it explains, easily and
satisfactorily, phenomena which other systems regard as abnormal
and exceptional.</p>

<p>When once the product has been thrown upon the market of
the world, do the general tendencies of society operate towards
elevating or towards depressing its <em class="e000I2">value</em>? This is to ask whether
the particular kind of services which have engendered this value
are liable to become more or less appreciated, and better or worse
remunerated. The one is as possible as the other, and it is this
which opens an unlimited field to human foresight.</p>

<p>This we may remark at least, that the general law of beings,
capable of making experiments, of acquiring information, and of
rectifying mistakes, is progress. The probability, then, is, that at
any given period a certain amount of time and pains will effect
greater results than were effected by the same agency at an
anterior period: whence we may conclude that the prevailing
tendency of <em class="e000I2">value</em>, <em class="e000I2">incorporated</em> with a commodity, is to fall. If,
for example, we suppose the cup which I took by way of illustration,
and as a symbol of other products, to have been made many
years ago, the probability is that it has undergone depreciation,
inasmuch as we have at the present day more resources for the
manufacture of such articles, more skill, better tools, capital <a id="p178" class="xxpn">[p178]</a>
obtained on easier terms, and a more extended division of labour.
In this way the person who wishes to obtain the cup does not say
to its possessor, Tell me the exact amount of labour (quantity and
quality both taken into account) which that cup has cost you, in
order that I may remunerate you accordingly. No, he says, Now-a-days,
in consequence of the progress of art, I can make for
myself, or procure by exchange, a similar cup at the expense of so
much labour of such a quality; and that is the limit of the remuneration
which I can consent to give you.</p>

<p>Hence it follows that all labour incorporated with commodities,
in other words, all accumulated labour, all capital, has a tendency
to become depreciated in presence of services naturally improvable
and increasingly and progressively productive; and that, in exchanging
present labour against anterior labour, the advantage is
generally on the side of present labour, as it ought to be, seeing
that it renders a greater amount of service.</p>

<p>This shows us how empty are the declamations which we hear
continually directed against the value of landed property. That
value differs from other values in nothing—neither in its origin,
nor in its nature, nor in the general law of its slow depreciation,
as compared with the labour which it originally cost.</p>

<p>It represents anterior services,—the clearing away of trees and
stones, draining, enclosing, levelling, manuring, building: it
demands the recompense of these services. But that recompense
is not regulated with reference to the labour which has been
actually performed. The landed proprietor does not say. “Give
me in exchange for this land as much labour as it has received
from me.” (But he would so express himself if, according to
Adam Smith’s theory, value came from labour, and were proportional
to it.) Much less does he say, as Ricardo and a number of
economists suppose, “Give me first of all as much labour as this
land has had bestowed upon it, and a certain amount of labour
over and above, as an equivalent for the natural and inherent
powers of the soil.” No, the proprietor, who represents all the
possessors of the land who have preceded him, up to those who
made the first clearance, is obliged, in their name, to hold this
humble language:—</p>

<p>“We have prepared services, and what we ask is to exchange
these for equivalent services. We worked hard formerly, for in
our days we were not acquainted with your powerful means of
execution—there were no roads—we were forced to do everything
by muscular exertion. Much sweat and toil, many human lives,
are buried under these furrows. But we do not expect from you <a id="p179" class="xxpn">[p179]</a>
labour for labour—we have no means of effecting an exchange on
those terms. We are quite aware that the labour bestowed on
land now-a-days, whether in this country or abroad, is much more
perfect and much more productive than formerly. All that we
ask, and what you clearly cannot refuse us, is that our anterior
labour and the new labour shall be exchanged, not in proportion
to their comparative duration and intensity, but proportionally to
their results, so that we may both receive the same remuneration
for the same service. By this arrangement we are losers as
regards labour, seeing that three or four times more of ours than
of yours is required to accomplish the same service; but we have
no choice, and can no longer effect the exchange on any other
terms.”</p>

<p>And, in point of fact, this represents the actual state of things.
If we could form an exact estimate of the amount of efforts, of
incessant labour, and toil, expended in bringing each acre of our
land to its present state of productiveness, we should be thoroughly
convinced that the man who purchases that land does not give
labour for labour—at least in ninety-nine cases out of the hundred.</p>

<p>I add this qualification, because we must not forget that an
<em class="e000I2">incorporated service</em> may gain value as well as lose it. And
although the general tendency be towards depreciation, nevertheless
the opposite phenomenon manifests itself sometimes, in
exceptional circumstances, as well in the case of land as of anything
else, and this without violating the law of justice, or affording
adequate cause for the cry of monopoly.</p>

<p>Services always intervene to bring out the principle of value.
In most cases the anterior labour probably renders a less amount
of service than the new labour, but this is not an absolute law
which admits of no exception. If the anterior labour renders a
less amount of service than the new, as is nearly always the case,
a greater quantity of the first than of the second must be thrown
into the scale to establish the equiponderance, seeing that the
equiponderance is regulated by services. But if it happen, as it
sometimes may, that the anterior labour renders greater service
than the new, the latter must make up for this by the sacrifice of
quantity. <a id="p180" class="xxpn">[p180]</a></p>

<h2 title="VI. Wealth"><a id="VI"></a>VI.<br />
WEALTH.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
We have seen that in every commodity which is adapted to satisfy
our wants and desires, there are two things to be considered and
distinguished: what nature does, and what man does,—what is
gratuitous, and what is onerous—the gift of God and the service
of man—<em class="e000I2">utility</em> and <em class="e000I2">value</em>. In the same commodity the one may
be immense, and the other imperceptible. The former remaining
invariable, the latter may be indefinitely diminished; and is
diminished, in fact, as often as an ingenious process or invention
enables us to obtain the same result with less effort.</p>

<p>One of the greatest difficulties, one of the most fertile sources of
misunderstanding, controversy, and error, here presents itself to
us at the very threshold of the science—</p>

<p>What is <em class="e000I2">wealth</em>?</p>

<p>Are we <em class="e000I2">rich</em> in proportion to the utilities which we have at our
disposal,—that is, in proportion to the wants and desires which we
have the means of satisfying? “A man is rich or poor,” says
Adam Smith, “according as he possesses a greater or smaller
amount of <em class="e000I2">useful</em> commodities which minister to his enjoyments.”</p>

<p>Are we <em class="e000I2">rich</em> in proportion to the <em class="e000I2">values</em> which we possess,—that
is to say, the <em class="e000I2">services</em> which we can command? “Wealth,” says
J. B. Say, “is in proportion to Value. It is great if the sum of
the value of which it is composed is great—it is small if the value
be small.”</p>

<p>The vulgar employ the word Wealth in two senses. Sometimes
we hear them say—“The abundance of water is Wealth to
such a country.” In this case, they are thinking only of utility.
But when one wishes to reckon up his own wealth, he makes what
is called an Inventory, in which only commercial Value is taken
into account.</p>

<p>With deference to the <em class="e000I2">savants</em>, I believe that the vulgar are
<a id="p181" class="xxpn">[p181]</a> right for once. Wealth is either <em class="e000I2">actual</em> or <em class="e000I2">relative</em>. In the first
point of view, we judge of it by our satisfactions. Mankind
become richer in proportion as they acquire a greater amount of
ease or material prosperity, whatever be the commodities by which
it is procured. But do you wish to know what proportional share
each man has in the general prosperity; in other words, his <em class="e000I2">relative
wealth</em>? This is simply a relation, which value alone reveals,
because value is itself a relation.</p>

<p>Our science has to do with the general welfare and prosperity of
men, with the proportion which exists between their Efforts and their
Satisfactions,—a proportion which the progressive participation of
gratuitous utility in the business of production modifies advantageously.
You cannot, then, exclude this element from the idea
of Wealth. In a scientific point of view, actual or effective wealth
is not the sum of values, but the aggregate of the utilities, gratuitous
and onerous, which are attached to these values. As regards
satisfactions,—that is to say, as regards actual results of wealth,
we are as much enriched by the value annihilated by progress as
by that which still subsists.</p>

<p>In the ordinary transactions of life, we cease to take utility into
account, in proportion as that utility becomes <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> by the
lowering of value. Why? because what is gratuitous is <em class="e000I2">common</em>,
and what is common alters in no respect each man’s share or proportion
of actual or effective wealth. We do not exchange what
is common to all; and as in our every-day transactions we only
require to be made acquainted with the proportion which value
establishes, we take no account of anything else.</p>

<p>This subject gave rise to a controversy between Ricardo and J.
B. Say. Ricardo gave to the word Wealth the sense of Utility—Say,
that of Value. The exclusive triumph of one of these champions
was impossible, since the word admits of both senses,
according as we regard wealth as actual or relative.</p>

<p>But it is necessary to remark, and the more so on account of the
great authority of Say in these matters, that if we confound <em class="e000I2">wealth</em>
(in the sense of actual or effective prosperity) with <em class="e000I2">value</em>; above
all, if we affirm that the one is proportional to the other, we shall
be apt to give the science a wrong direction. The works of
second-rate Economists, and those of the Socialists, show this but
too clearly. To set out by concealing from view precisely that
which forms the fairest patrimony of the human race, is an unfortunate
beginning. It leads us to consider as annihilated that portion
of wealth which progress renders common to all, and exposes
us to the danger of falling into a <em class="e000I2">petitio principii</em>, and studying
<a id="p182" class="xxpn">[p182]</a> Political Economy backwards,—the <em class="e000I2">end</em>, the design, which it is
our object to attain, being perpetually confounded with the <em class="e000I2">obstacle</em>
which impedes our efforts.</p>

<p>In truth, but for the existence of obstacles, there could be no
such thing as Value, which is the sign, the symptom, the witness,
the proof of our native weakness. It reminds us incessantly of
the decree which went forth in the beginning—“In the sweat of
thy face shalt thou eat bread.” With reference to Omnipotence,
the words <em class="e000I2">Effort</em>, <em class="e000I2">Service</em>, and, consequently, <em class="e000I2">Value</em>, have no
meaning. As regards ourselves, we live in an atmosphere of
<em class="e000I2">utilities</em>, of which utilities the greater part are gratuitous, but there
are others which we can acquire only by an onerous title. Obstacles
are interposed between these utilities and the wants to
which they minister. We are condemned either to forego the
Utility, or vanquish these obstacles by Efforts. Sweat must drop
from the brow before bread can be eaten, whether the toil be
undergone by ourselves or by others for our benefit.</p>

<p>The greater the amount of value we find existing in a country,
the greater evidence we have that obstacles have been surmounted,
but the greater evidence we also have that there are obstacles to
surmount. Are we to go so far as to say that these obstacles
constitute Wealth, because, apart from them, Value would have
no existence?</p>

<p>We may suppose two countries. One of them possesses the
means of enjoyment to a greater extent than the other with a less
amount of Value, because it is favoured by nature, and it has fewer
obstacles to overcome. Which is the richer?</p>

<p>Or, to put a stronger case, let us suppose the same people at
different periods of their history. The obstacles to be overcome
are the same at both periods. But, now-a-days, they surmount
these obstacles with so much greater facility; they execute, for
instance, the work of transport, of tillage, of manufactures, at so
much less an expense of effort that values are considerably reduced.
There are two courses, then, which a people in such a situation
may take,—they may content themselves with the same amount
of enjoyments as formerly,—progress in that case resolving itself
simply into the attainment of additional leisure; and, in such
circumstances, should we be authorized to say that the Wealth of
the society had retrograded because it is possessed of a smaller
amount of value? Or, they may devote the efforts which progress
and improvement have rendered disposable to the increase and
extension of their enjoyments; but should we be warranted to
conclude that, because the amount of values had remained <a id="p183" class="xxpn">[p183]</a> stationary,
the wealth of the society had remained stationary also? It
is to this result, however, that we tend if we confound the two
things, <em class="e000I2">Riches</em> and <em class="e000I2">Value</em>.</p>

<p>Political Economists may here find themselves in a dilemma.
Are we to measure wealth by Satisfactions realized, or by Values
created?</p>

<p>Were no obstacles interposed between utilities and desires, there
would be neither efforts, nor services, nor Values in our case, any
more than in that of God and nature. In such circumstances,
were wealth estimated by the satisfactions realized, mankind, like
nature, would be in possession of infinite riches; but, if estimated
by the values created, they would be deprived of wealth altogether.
An economist who adopted the first view might pronounce us
<em class="e000I2">infinitely rich</em>,—another, who adopted the second view, might pronounce
us <em class="e000I2">infinitely poor</em>.</p>

<p>The infinite, it is true, is in no respect an attribute of humanity.
But mankind direct their exertions to certain ends; they make
efforts, they have tendencies, they gravitate towards progressive
Wealth or progressive Poverty. Now, how could Economists
make themselves mutually intelligible if this successive diminution
of effort in relation to result, of labour to be undergone or to
be remunerated; in a word, if this successive diminution of Value
were considered by some of them as a progress towards Wealth,
and by others as a descent towards Poverty?</p>

<p>Did the difficulty, indeed, concern only Economists, we might
say, let them settle the matter among themselves. But legislators
and governments have every day to introduce measures which
exercise a serious influence on human affairs; and in what condition
should we be if these measures were taken in the absence of
that light which enables us to distinguish Riches from Poverty?</p>

<p>I affirm that the theory which defines Wealth as Value is only
the glorification of Obstacles. Its syllogism is this: “Wealth is
in proportion to Value, value to efforts, efforts to obstacles; <em class="e000I2">ergo</em>,
wealth is in proportion to obstacles.” I affirm also that, by reason
of the division of labour, which includes the case of every one who
exercises a trade or profession, the illusion thus created is very
difficult to be got rid of. We all of us see that the services which
we render are called forth by some obstacle, some want, some
suffering,—those of the physician by disease, those of the agricultural
labourer by hunger, those of the manufacturer of clothing by
cold, those of the carrier by distance, those of the advocate by
injustice, those of the soldier by danger to his country. There is
not, in fact, a single obstacle, the disappearance of which does not
<a id="p184" class="xxpn">[p184]</a> prove very inopportune and very troublesome to somebody, or
which does not even appear fatal in a public point of view, because
it seems to dry up a source of employment, of services, of values,
of wealth. Very few Economists have been able to preserve
themselves entirely from this illusion; and if the science shall ever
succeed in dispelling it, its practical mission will have been fulfilled.
For I venture to make a third affirmation—namely, that our official
practice is saturated with this theory, and that when governments
believe it to be their duty to favour certain classes, certain professions,
or certain manufactures, they have no other mode of accomplishing
their object than by setting up Obstacles, in order to give
to particular branches of industry additional development, in order
to enlarge artificially the circle of services to which the community
is forced to have recourse,—and thus to increase Value, falsely
assumed as synonymous with Wealth.</p>

<p>And, in fact, it is quite true that such legislation is useful to
the classes which are favoured by it—they exult in it—congratulate
each other upon it,—and what is the consequence? Why
this, that the same favours are successively accorded to all other
classes.</p>

<p>What more natural than to confound Utility with Value, and
Value with Riches! The science has never encountered a snare
which she has less suspected. For what has happened? At every
step of progress the reasoning has been this: “The obstacle is
diminished, then effort is lessened, then value is lessened, then
utility is lessened, then wealth is lessened,—then we are the most
unfortunate people in the world to have taken it into our heads to
invent and exchange, to have five fingers in place of three, and
two hands in place of one; and then it is necessary to engage
government, which is in possession of force, to take order with
this abuse.”</p>

<p>This Political Economy <em class="e000I2">à rebours</em>—this Political Economy read
backwards—is the staple of many of our journals, and the life of
legislative assemblies. It has misled the candid and philanthropic
Sismondi, and we find it very logically set forth in the work of
M. de Saint-Chamans.</p>

<p>“There are two kinds of national wealth,” he tells us. “If we
have regard only to <em class="e000I2">useful</em> products with reference to their quantity,
their abundance, we have to do with a species of wealth
which procures enjoyments to society, and which I shall denominate
<em class="e000I2">the Wealth of enjoyment</em>.</p>

<p>“If we regard products with reference to their exchangeable
Value, or simply with reference to their value, we have to do with
<a id="p185" class="xxpn">[p185]</a> a species of Wealth which procures values to society, and which I
call <em class="e000I2">the Wealth of value</em>.</p>

<p>“<em class="e000I2">It is this last species of Wealth which forms the special subject
of Political Economy, and it is with it, above all, that governments
have to do.</em>”</p>

<p>This being so, how are Economists and Statesmen to proceed?
The first are to point out the means of increasing this species of
riches, this <em class="e000I2">wealth of value</em>; the second to set about adopting these
means.</p>

<p>But this kind of wealth bears proportion to efforts, and efforts
bear proportion to obstacles. Political Economy, then, is to
teach, and Government to contrive, how to multiply obstacles.
M. de Saint-Chamans does not flinch in the least from this consequence.</p>

<p>Does exchange facilitate our acquiring more of the <em class="e000I2">wealth of
enjoyment</em> with less of the <em class="e000I2">wealth of value</em>? We must, then,
counteract this tendency of exchange.<a
href="#FN_39" id="FNa_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>Is there any portion of gratuitous Utility which we can replace
by onerous Utility; for example, by prohibiting the use of a tool
or a machine? We must not fail to do so; for it is very evident,
he says, that if machinery augments the <em class="e000I2">wealth of enjoyment</em>, it
diminishes the <em class="e000I2">wealth of value</em>. “<em class="e000I2">Let us bless the obstacles</em> which
the dearness and scarcity of fuel in this country has opposed to
the multiplication of steam-engines.”<a
href="#FN_40" id="FNa_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>Has nature favoured us in any particular respect? It is our
misfortune; for, by that means, we are deprived of the opportunity
of exerting ourselves. “I avow that I could desire to see manufactured
by manual labour, forced exertion, and the sweat of the
brow, things that are now produced without trouble and spontaneously.”<a
href="#FN_41" id="FNa_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>What a misfortune, then, is it for us that we are not obliged to
manufacture the water which we drink! It would have been a
fine opportunity of producing the <em class="e000I2">wealth of value</em>. Happily we
take our revenge upon wine. “Discover the secret of drawing
wine from springs in the earth as abundantly as you draw water,
and you will soon see that this fine order of things will ruin a
fourth part of France.”<a
href="#FN_42" id="FNa_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>According to the ideas which this Economist sets forth with
such <em class="e000I2">naïveté</em>, there are many methods, and very simple methods
too, of obliging men to create what he terms the <em class="e000I2">wealth of value</em>.</p>

<p>The first is to deprive them of what they have. “If taxation
<a id="p186" class="xxpn">[p186]</a> lays held of money where it is plentiful, to distribute it where it
is scarce, it is useful, and far from being a loss, <em class="e000I2">it is a gain</em>, to the
state.”<a
href="#FN_43" id="FNa_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>The second is to dissipate what you take. “Luxury and prodigality,
which are so hurtful to individual fortunes, <em class="e000I2">benefit</em> public
wealth. You teach me a fine moral lesson, it may be said—I have
no such pretension—my business is with Political Economy, and
not with morals. You seek the means of rendering nations richer,
and I preach up luxury.”<a
href="#FN_44" id="FNa_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>A more prompt method still is to destroy the wealth which you
take from the tax-payer by good sweeping wars. “If you grant
me that the expenditure of prodigals is as productive as any other,
and that the expenditure of governments is equally productive,
.&#160;.&#160;. you will no longer be astonished at the wealth of England
after so expensive a war.”<a
href="#FN_45" id="FNa_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>But, as tending to promote the creation of this <em class="e000I2">Wealth of value</em>,
all these means—taxes, luxury, wars—must hide their diminished
heads before an expedient infinitely more efficacious—namely,
<em class="e000I2">conflagration</em>.</p>

<p>“To build is a great source of wealth, because it supplies revenues
to proprietors, who furnish the materials, to workmen, and
to divers classes of artisans and artists. Melon cites Sir William
Petty, who regards, as a <em class="e000I2">national profit</em>, the labour employed in rebuilding
the streets of London after the great fire which consumed
two-thirds of the city, and he estimates it (the profit!) at a million
sterling per annum (in money of 1666) during four years, and this
without the least injury having been done to other branches of
trade. Without regarding this pecuniary estimate <em class="e000I2">of profit</em> as quite
accurate,” adds M. de Saint-Chamans, “it is certain at least that
this event had no detrimental effect upon the wealth of England
at that period.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. The result stated by Sir W. Petty is
not impossible, seeing that the necessity of rebuilding London
must have created a large amount of new revenues.”<a
href="#FN_46" id="FNa_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>All Economists, who set out by confounding <em class="e000I2">wealth</em> with <em class="e000I2">value</em>,
must infallibly arrive at the same conclusions, if they are logical;
but they are not logical; for on the road of absurdity men of any
common sense always sooner or later stop short. M. de Saint-Chamans
seems himself to recede a little before the consequences
of his principle, when it lands him in a eulogium on conflagration.
We see that he hesitates, and contents himself with a
negative panegyric. He should have carried out his principle to
<a id="p187" class="xxpn">[p187]</a> its logical conclusions, and told us roundly what he so clearly
indicates.</p>

<p>Of all our Economists, M. de Sismondi has succumbed to the
difficulty now under consideration in the manner most to be regretted.
Like M. de Saint-Chamans, he set out with the idea
that value forms an element of wealth; and, like him, he has built
upon this datum a Political Economy <em class="e000I2">à rebours</em>, denouncing everything
which tends to diminish value. Sismondi, like Saint-Chamans,
exalts obstacles, proscribes machinery, anathematizes
exchange, competition, and liberty, extols luxury and taxation,
and arrives at length at this conclusion, that the more we possess
the poorer we become.<a
href="#FN_47" id="FNa_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>From beginning to end of his work, however, M. de Sismondi
seems to have a lurking consciousness that he is mistaken, and
that a dark veil may have interposed itself between his mind and
the truth. He does not venture, like M. de Saint-Chamans, to
announce roughly and bluntly the consequences of his principle—he
hesitates, and is troubled. He asks himself sometimes if it is
possible that all men from the beginning of the world have been
in error, and on the road to self-destruction, in seeking to diminish
the proportion which Effort bears to Satisfaction,—that is to say,
<em class="e000I2">value</em>. At once the friend and the enemy of liberty, he fears it,
since the abundance which depreciates value leads to universal
poverty, and yet he knows not how to set about the destruction of
this fatal liberty. He thus arrives at the confines of socialism and
artificial organization, and insinuates that government and science
should regulate and control everything. Then he sees the danger
of the advice he is giving, retracts it, and ends by falling into
despair, exclaiming—“Liberty leads to the abyss of poverty—Constraint
is as impossible as it is useless—there is no escape.” In
truth and reality, there is none, if Value be Riches; in other
words, if the obstacle to prosperity be prosperity itself,—that is to
say, if Evil be Good.</p>

<p>The latest writer, as far as I know, who has stirred this question
<a id="p188" class="xxpn">[p188]</a> is M. Proudhon. It made the fortune of his book, <em class="e000I2">Des
Contradictions Économiques</em>. Never was there a finer opportunity
of seizing a paradox by the forelock, and snapping his fingers at
science. Never was there a fairer occasion of asking—“Do you
see in the increase of value a good or an evil? <em class="e000I2">Quidquid dixeris
argumentabor.</em>” Just think what a treat!<a
href="#FN_48" id="FNa_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>“I call upon any earnest Economist to explain to me, otherwise
than by varying and repeating the question, why value diminishes
in proportion as production increases, and <em class="e000I2">vice versa</em>.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. In
technical phrase, value in use and value in exchange, although
necessary to each other, are in an inverse ratio to each other.&#032;.&#032;.&#032;.&#032;.
Value in use and value in exchange remain, then, fatally
enchained, although in their own nature they tend to exclude each
other.”</p>

<p>“For this contradiction, which is inherent in the notion of
value, no cause can be assigned, nor is any explanation of it
possible.&#160;.&#160;. From the data, that man has need of a great variety
of commodities, and that he must provide them by his labour, the
necessary conclusion is, that there exists an antagonism between
value in use and value in exchange, and from this antagonism a
contradiction arises at the very threshold of Political Economy.
No amount of intelligence, no agency, divine or human, can make
it otherwise. In place, then, of beating about for a useless explanation,
let us content ourselves with pointing out clearly the
<em class="e000I2">necessity of the contradiction</em>.”</p>

<p>We know that the grand discovery of M. Proudhon is, that
everything is at once true and false, good and bad, legitimate and
illegitimate, that there exits no principle which is not self-contradictory,
and that contradiction lurks not only in erroneous
theories, but in the very essence of things,—“it is the pure
expression of necessity, the peculiar law of existence,” etc.; so
that it is inevitable, and would be incurable, rationally, but for
<em class="e000I2">progression</em>, and, practically, but for the <em class="e000I2">Banque du Peuple</em>. Nature
is a contradiction, liberty a contradiction, competition a contradiction,
property a contradiction,—value, credit, monopoly, community,
all contradictions. When M. Proudhon achieved this
wonderful discovery his heart must have leaped for joy; for since
contradiction is everywhere and in everything, he can never want
something to gainsay, which for him is the supreme good. He
said to me one day, “I should rather like to go to heaven, but I
<a id="p189" class="xxpn">[p189]</a> fear that everybody there will be of one mind, and I should find
nobody to argue with.”</p>

<p>We must confess that the subject of Value gave him an excellent
opportunity of indulging his taste. But, with great deference
to him, the contradictions and paradoxes to which the word Value
has given rise are to be found in the false theories which have
been constructed, and not at all, as he would have us believe, in
the nature of things.</p>

<p>Theorists have set out, in the first instance, by confounding
Value with Utility,—that is to say, evil with good; for utility is
the desired result, and value springs from the obstacle which is
interposed between the desire and the result. This was their first
error, and, when they perceived the consequences of it, they
thought to obviate the difficulty by imagining a distinction between
value in use and value in exchange—an unwieldy tautology,
which had the great fault of attaching the same word—Value—to
two opposite phenomena.</p>

<p>But if, putting aside these subtilties, we adhere strictly to facts,
what do we perceive? Nothing, assuredly, but what is quite
natural and consistent.</p>

<p>A man, we shall suppose, works exclusively for himself. If he
acquire skill, if his force and intelligence are developed, if nature
becomes more liberal, or if he learns how to make nature co-operate
better in his work, he obtains <em class="e000I2">more wealth with less trouble</em>.
Where is the contradiction, and what is there in this to excite so
much wonder?</p>

<p>Well, then, in place of remaining an isolated being, suppose
this man to have relations with his fellow-men. They exchange;
and I repeat my observation,—in proportion as they acquire skill,
experience, force, and intelligence,—in proportion as nature (become
more liberal or brought more into subjection) lends them
more efficacious co-operation, they obtain <em class="e000I2">more wealth with less
trouble</em>; they have at their disposal a greater amount of gratuitous
utility; in their transactions they transfer to one another a greater
sum of useful results in proportion to a given amount of labour.
Where, then, is the contradiction?</p>

<p>If, indeed, following the example of Adam Smith and his successors,
you commit the error of applying the same denomination—<em class="e000I2">value</em>—both
to the results obtained and to the exertion made;
in that case, an antinomy or contradiction will show itself. But
be assured that that contradiction is not at all in the facts, but in
your own erroneous explanation of those facts.</p>

<p>M. Proudhon ought, then, to have shaped his proposition thus:
<a id="p190" class="xxpn">[p190]</a> It being granted that man has need of a great variety of products,
that he can only obtain them by his labour, and that he has the
precious gift of educating and improving himself, nothing in the
world is more natural than the sustained increase of results in
relation to efforts; and there is nothing at all contradictory in a
given value serving as the vehicle of a greater amount of realized
utility.</p>

<p>Let me repeat, once more, that for man Utility is the fair side of
the medal and Value the reverse. Utility has relation only to our
Satisfactions, Value only with our Pains. Utility realizes our
enjoyments, and is proportioned to them; Value attests our native
weakness, springs from obstacles, and is proportioned to those
Obstacles.</p>

<p>In virtue of the law of human perfectibility, gratuitous utility
tends more and more to take the place of onerous utility, expressed
by the word <em class="e000I2">value</em>. Such is the phenomenon, and it presents
assuredly nothing contradictory.</p>

<p>But the question recurs—Should the word Wealth comprehend
these two kinds of utility united, or only the last?</p>

<p>If we could form, once for all, two classes of utilities, putting
on the one side all those which are gratuitous, and on the other
all those which are onerous, we should form, at the same time, two
classes of Wealth, which we should denominate, with M. Say,
<em class="e000I2">Natural Wealth</em> and <em class="e000I2">Social Wealth</em>; or else, with M. de Saint-Chamans,
the <em class="e000I2">Wealth of Enjoyment</em> and the <em class="e000I2">Wealth of Value</em>;
after which, as these authors propose, we should have nothing
mere to do with the first of these classes.</p>

<p>“Things which are accessible to all,” says M. Say, “and which
everyone may enjoy at pleasure, without being forced to acquire
them, and without the fear of exhausting them, such as air, water,
the light of the sun, etc., are the gratuitous gifts of nature, and
may be denominated <em class="e000I2">Natural Wealth</em>. As these can be neither
produced nor distributed, nor consumed by us, <em class="e000I2">they come not within
the domain of Political Economy</em>.</p>

<p>“The things which this science has to do with are things which
we possess, and which have a recognised value. These we denominate
<em class="e000I2">Social Wealth</em>, because they exist only among men united
in society.”</p>

<p>“It is the <em class="e000I2">Wealth of Value</em>,” says M. de Saint-Chamans,
“<em class="e000I2">which forms the special subject of Political Economy</em>, and whenever
in this work I mention Wealth without being more specific, I mean
that description of it.”</p>

<p>Nearly all Economists have taken the same view. <a id="p191" class="xxpn">[p191]</a></p>

<p>“The most striking distinction,” says Storch, “which presents
itself in the outset, is, that there are certain kinds of value which
are capable of appropriation, and other kinds which are not so.<a
href="#FN_49" id="FNa_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
<em class="e000I2">The first alone are the subject of Political Economy</em>, for the analysis
of the others would furnish no result worthy of the attention of
the statesman.”</p>

<p>For my own part, I think that that portion of utility which, in
the progress of society, ceases to be onerous and to possess value,
but which does not on that account cease to be utility, and is about
to fall into the domain of the <em class="e000I2">common</em> and <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>, is precisely
that which should constantly attract the attention of the statesman
and of the Economist. If it do not, in place of penetrating and
comprehending the great results which affect and elevate the
human race, the science will be left to deal with what is quite
contingent and flexible—with what has a tendency to diminish, if
not to disappear—with a relation merely; in a word, with Value.
Without being aware of it, Economists are thus led to consider
only labour, obstacles, and the interest of the producer; and, what
is worse, they are led to confound the interest of the producer with
the interest of the public,—that is to say, to mistake evil for good,
and, under the guidance of the Sismondis and Saint-Chamans,
to land at length in the Utopia of the socialists, or the <em class="e000I2">Système des
Contradictions</em> of Proudhon.</p>

<p>And, then, is not this line of demarcation, which you attempt
to draw between the two descriptions of utility, chimerical, arbitrary,
and impossible? How can you thus disjoin the co-operation
of nature and that of man when they combine and get mixed up
everywhere, much more when the one tends constantly to replace
the other, which is precisely what constitutes progress? If
economical science, so dry in some respects, in other aspects elevates
and fascinates the mind, it is just because it describes the
laws of this association between man and nature,—it is because it
shows gratuitous utility substituting itself more and more for
onerous utility, enjoyments bearing a greater and greater proportion
to labour and fatigue, obstacles constantly lessening, and,
along with them, value; the perpetual mistakes and miscalculations
of producers more than compensated by the increasing prosperity
of consumers; natural wealth, <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> and <em class="e000I2">common</em>,
coming more and more to take the place of wealth which is <em class="e000I2">personal</em>
and <em class="e000I2">appropriated</em>. What! are we to exclude from Political
Economy what constitutes its religious Harmony? <a id="p192" class="xxpn">[p192]</a></p>

<p>Air, light, water, are gratuitous, you say. True, and if we
enjoyed them under their primitive form, without making them
co-operate in any of our works, we might exclude them from
Political Economy just as we exclude from it the possible and
probable utility of comets. But observe the progress of man. At
first he is able to make air, light, water, and other natural agents
co-operate very imperfectly. His satisfactions were purchased by
laborious personal efforts, they exacted a large amount of labour,
and they were transferred to others as important <em class="e000I2">services</em>; in a
word, they were possessed of great <em class="e000I2">value</em>. By degrees, this water,
this air, this light, gravitation, elasticity, calorie, electricity, vegetable
life, have abandoned this state of relative inactivity. They
mingle more and more with our industry. They are substituted
for human labour. They do for us gratuitously what labour does
only for an onerous consideration. They annihilate value without
diminishing our enjoyments. To speak in common language,
what cost us a hundred francs, costs us only ten—what required
ten days’ labour now demands only one. The whole value thus
annihilated has passed from the domain of Property to that of
Community. A considerable proportion of human efforts has
been set free, and placed at our disposal for other enterprises; so
that with equal labour, equal services, equal value, mankind have
enlarged prodigiously the circle of their enjoyments; and yet you
tell me that I must eliminate and banish from the science this
utility, which is gratuitous and common, which alone explains
progress, as well upward as forward, if I may so speak, as well in
wealth and prosperity as in freedom and equality!</p>

<p>We may, then, legitimately attach to the word Wealth two
meanings.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Effective Wealth</em>, real, and realizing satisfactions, or the aggregate
of utilities which human labour, aided by the co-operation of
natural agents, places within the reach of Society.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Relative Wealth</em>,—that is to say, the proportional share of each
in the general Riches, a share which is determined by Value.</p>

<p>This Economic Harmony, then, may be thus stated:</p>

<p>By labour the action of man is combined with the action of
nature.</p>

<p>Utility results from that co-operation.</p>

<p>Each man receives a share of the general utility proportioned to
the value he has created,—that is to say, to the services he has
rendered; in other words, to the utility he has himself produced.<a
href="#FN_50" id="FNa_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> <a id="p193" class="xxpn">[p193]</a></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Morality of Wealth.</em>—We have just been engaged in studying
wealth in an economical point of view; it may not perhaps be
useless to say something here of its Moral effects.</p>

<p>In all ages, wealth, in a moral point of view, has been the subject
of controversy. Certain philosophers and certain religionists
have commanded us to despise it; others have greatly prided
themselves on the golden mean, <em class="e000I2">aurea mediocritas</em>. Few, if any,
have admitted as moral an ardent longing after the goods of fortune.</p>

<p>Which are right? Which are wrong? It does not belong to
Political Economy to treat of individual morality. I shall make
only one remark: I am always inclined to think that in matters
which lie within the domain of everyday practice, theorists,
savants, philosophers, are much less likely to be right than this
universal practice itself, when we include in the meaning of the
word practice, not only the actions of the generality of men, but
their sentiments and ideas.</p>

<p>Now, what does universal practice demonstrate in this case?
It shows us all men endeavouring to emerge from their original
state of poverty,—all preferring the sensation of satisfaction to
the sensation of want, riches to poverty; all, I should say, or
almost all, without excepting even those who declaim against
wealth.</p>

<p>The desire for wealth is ardent, incessant, universal, irrepressible.
In almost every part of the globe it has triumphed over
our natural aversion to toil. Whatever may be said to the contrary,
it displays a character of avidity still baser among savage
than among civilized nations. All our navigators who left Europe
in the eighteenth century, imbued with the fashionable ideas of
Rousseau, and expecting to find the men of nature at the antipodes
disinterested, generous, hospitable, were struck with the devouring
rapacity of these primitive barbarians. Our military men can tell
us, in our own day, what we are to think of the boasted disinterestedness
of the Arab tribes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the opinions of all men, even of those who
do not act up to their opinions, concur in honouring disinterestedness,
generosity, self-control, and in branding that ill-regulated,
inordinate love of wealth which causes men not to shrink from
any means of obtaining it. The same public opinion surrounds with
esteem the man who, in whatever rank of life, devotes his honest
and persevering labour to ameliorating the lot and elevating the
condition of his family. It is from this combination of facts, ideas,
and sentiments, it would seem to me, that we must form our judgment
on wealth in connexion with individual morality. <a id="p194" class="xxpn">[p194]</a></p>

<p>First of all, we must acknowledge that the motive which urges
us to the acquisition of riches is of providential creation,—natural,
and consequently <em class="e000I2">moral</em>. It has its source in that original and
general destitution which would be our lot in everything, if it did
not create in us the desire to free ourselves from it. We must
acknowledge, in the second place, that the efforts which men make
to emerge from their primitive destitution, provided they keep
within the limits of justice, are estimable and respectable, seeing
that they are universally esteemed and respected. No one, moreover,
will deny that labour is in itself of a moral nature. This is
expressed in the common proverb which we find in all countries,—Idleness
is the parent of vice. And we should fall into a glaring
contradiction were we to say, on the one hand, that labour is
indispensable to the morality of men, and, on the other, that
men are immoral when they seek to realize wealth by their
labour.</p>

<p>We must acknowledge, in the third place, that the desire of
wealth becomes immoral when it goes the length of inducing us to
depart from the rules of justice, and that avarice becomes more unpopular
in proportion to the wealth of those who addict themselves
to that passion.</p>

<p>Such is the judgment pronounced, not by certain philosophers
or sects, but by the generality of men; and I adopt it.</p>

<p>I must guard myself, however, by adding that this judgment may
be different at the present day from what it was in ancient times,
without involving a contradiction.</p>

<p>The Essenians and Stoics lived in a state of society where
wealth was always the reward of oppression, of pillage, and of
violence. Not only was it deemed immoral in itself, but, in consequence
of the immoral means employed in its acquisition, it
revealed the immorality of those who possessed it. A reaction,
even an exaggerated reaction, against riches and rich men was to
be expected. Modern philosophers who declaim against wealth,
without taking into account this difference in the means of
acquiring wealth, believe themselves Senecas, while they are only
parrots, repeating what they do not understand.</p>

<p>But the question which Political Economy proposes is this: Is
wealth for mankind a moral good or a moral evil? Does the progressive
development of wealth imply, in a moral point of view,
improvement or decadence?</p>

<p>The reader anticipates my answer, and will understand that I
must say a few words on the subject of individual morality, in
order to get quit of the contradiction, or rather of the impossibility,
<a id="p195" class="xxpn">[p195]</a> which would be implied in asserting that what is individual immorality
is general morality.</p>

<p>Without having recourse to statistics, or the records of our
prisons, we must handle a problem which may be enunciated in
these terms:—</p>

<p>Is man degraded by exercising more power over nature—by
constraining nature to serve him—by obtaining additional leisure—by
freeing himself from the more imperious and pressing wants
of his organization—by being enabled to rouse from sleep and inactivity
his intellectual and moral faculties,—faculties which
assuredly have not been given him to remain in eternal lethargy?</p>

<p>Is man degraded by being removed from a state the most inorganic,
so to speak, and raised to a state of the highest spiritualism
which it is possible for him to reach?</p>

<p>To enunciate the problem in this form is to resolve it.</p>

<p>I willingly grant, that when wealth is acquired by means which
are immoral, it has an immoral influence, as among the Romans.</p>

<p>I also allow that when it is developed in a very unequal manner,
creating a great gulf between classes, it has an immoral influence,
and gives rise to revolutionary passions.</p>

<p>But does the same thing hold when wealth is the fruit of honest
industry and free transactions, and is uniformly distributed over all
classes? That would be a doctrine which it is impossible to maintain.</p>

<p>Socialist works, nevertheless, are crammed with declamations
against the rich.</p>

<p>I really cannot comprehend how these schools, so opposite in
other respects, but so unanimous in this, should not perceive the
contradiction into which they fall.</p>

<p>On the one hand, wealth, according to the leaders of these
schools, has a deleterious and demoralizing action, which debases
the soul, hardens the heart, and leaves behind only a taste for
depraved enjoyments. The rich have all manner of vices. The
poor have all manner of virtues—they are just, sensible, disinterested,
generous,—such is the favourite theme of these authors.</p>

<p>On the other hand, all the efforts of the Socialists’ imagination,
all the systems they invent, all the laws they wish to impose upon
us, tend, if we are to believe them, to convert poverty into
riches.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>Morality of wealth proved by this
maxim; the profit of one is the profit of
another. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

CAPITAL.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
The economic laws will be found to act on the same principle,
whether we take the case of a numerous agglomeration of men or
of only two individuals, or even of a single individual condemned
by circumstances to live in a state of isolation.</p>

<p>Such an individual, if he could exist for some time in an isolated
state, would be at once capitalist, employer, workman, producer,
and consumer. The whole economic evolution would be accomplished
in him. Observing each of the elements of which that
evolution is made up—want, effort, satisfaction—gratuitous utility,
and onerous utility—he would be enabled to form an idea of the
entire mechanism, even when thus reduced to its greatest simplicity.</p>

<p>One thing is obvious enough, that he could never confound
what was gratuitous with what exacted efforts; for that would
imply a contradiction in terms. He would know at once
when a material or a force was furnished to him by nature
without the co-operation of his labour, even when his own labour
was assisted by natural agents, and thus rendered more productive.</p>

<p>An isolated individual would never think of applying his own
labour to the production of a commodity as long as he could procure
it directly from nature. He would not travel a league to
fetch water if he had a well at his door. For the same reason,
whenever his own labour was called into requisition, he would
endeavour to substitute for it, as much as he possibly could, the
co-operation of natural agents.</p>

<p>If he constructed a canoe, he would make it of the lightest
materials, in order to take advantage of the specific gravity of
water. He would furnish it with a sail, that the wind might save
him the trouble of rowing, etc. <a id="p197" class="xxpn">[p197]</a></p>

<p>In order to obtain in this way the co-operation of natural agent,
tools and instruments would be wanted.</p>

<p>And here the isolated individual would begin to calculate. He
would ask himself this question: At present I obtain a satisfaction
at the expense of a given effort: when I am in possession of
the proper tool or instrument, shall I obtain the same satisfaction
with less effort, taking into account the labour required for the
construction of the instrument itself?</p>

<p>No one will throw away his labour for the mere pleasure of
throwing it away. Our supposed Robinson Crusoe, then, will be
induced to set about constructing the instrument only if he sees
clearly that, when completed, he will obtain an equal satisfaction
at a smaller expense of effort, or a greater amount of satisfaction
with the same effort.</p>

<p>One circumstance will form a great element in his calculation—the
number of commodities in the production of which this instrument
will assist while it lasts. He has a primary standard of
comparison—the present labours to which he is subjected every
time he wishes to procure the satisfaction directly and without
assistance. He estimates how much labour the tool or instrument
will save him on each occasion; but labour is required to make
the tool, and this labour he will in his own mind spread over all
the occasions on which such an instrument can be made available.
The greater the number of these occasions, the stronger will be his
motive for seeking the co-operation of natural agents. It is here—in
this spreading of an <em class="e000I2">advance</em> over an aggregate of products—that
we discover the principle and foundation of Interest.</p>

<p>When Robin Crusoe has once made up his mind to construct
the instrument, he perceives that his willingness to make it, and the
advantage it is to bring him, are not enough. Tools are necessary
to the manufacture of tools—iron must be hammered with iron—and
so you go on, mounting from difficulty to difficulty, till you
reach the first difficulty of all, which appears to be insuperable.
This shows us the extreme slowness with which Capital must have
been formed at the beginning, and what an enormous amount of
human labour each satisfaction must originally have cost.</p>

<p>Again, in order to construct the instruments of labour, not only
tools, but <em class="e000I2">materials</em> are wanted. If these materials, as for instance
stones, are furnished gratuitously by nature, we must still combine
them, which costs labour. But the possession of these materials
supposes, in almost every case, anterior labour both long and complicated,
as in the manufacture of wool, flax, iron, lead, etc.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. Whilst a man is thus working for the exclusive
<a id="p198" class="xxpn">[p198]</a> purpose of facilitating his ulterior labour, he can do nothing to
supply his present wants. Now, here we encounter an order of
phenomena in which there can be no interruption. Each day
the labourer must be fed, clothed, and sheltered. Robinson will
perceive, then, that he can undertake nothing for the purpose of
procuring the co-operation of natural forces until he has previously
accumulated a stock of <em class="e000I2">provisions</em>. He must every day redouble
his activity in the chase, and store up a portion of the game he
kills, and subject himself to present privations, in order that he
may have at his disposal the time requisite for the construction of
the instrument he has projected. In such circumstances, it is most
probable that all he will accomplish will be the construction of an
instrument which is rude and imperfect, and not very well fitted
for the purpose he has in view.</p>

<p>Afterwards, he will obtain greater facilities. Reflection and
experience will teach him to work better; and the first tool he
makes will furnish him with the means of fabricating others, and
of accumulating provisions with greater promptitude.</p>

<p>Tools, materials, provisions—these, doubtless, Robinson will
denominate his <em class="e000I2">Capital</em>; and he will readily discover that the
more considerable his capital becomes, the greater command will
he obtain over natural agents—that the more he makes such
agents co-operate in his labour, the more will he augment his
satisfactions in proportion to his efforts.</p>

<p>Let us now vary the hypothesis, and place ourselves in the
midst of the social order. Capital is still composed of instruments
of labour, materials, and provisions, without which no
enterprise of any magnitude can be undertaken, either in a state
of isolation, or in a social state. Those who are possessed of
capital have been put in possession of it only by their labour, or
by their privations; and they would not have undergone that
labour (which has no connexion with present wants), they would
not have imposed on themselves those privations, but with the
view of obtaining ulterior advantages—with the view, for example,
of procuring in larger measure the future co-operation of natural
agents. On their part, to give away this capital would be to
deprive themselves of the special advantage they have in view;
it would be to transfer this advantage to others; it would be to
render others a <em class="e000I2">service</em>. We cannot, then, without abandoning the
most simple principles of reason and justice, fail to see that the
owners of capital have a perfect right to refuse to make this transfer
unless in exchange for another <em class="e000I2">service</em>, freely bargained for and
voluntarily agreed to. No man in the world, I believe, will dispute
<a id="p199" class="xxpn">[p199]</a> the equity of the <em class="e000I2">mutuality of services</em>, for mutuality of services
is, in other words, equity. Will it be said that the transaction
cannot be free and voluntary, because the man who is in possession
of capital is in a position to lay down the law to the man who has
none? But how is a bargain to be made? In what way are we
to discover the <em class="e000I2">equivalence of services</em> if it be not in the case of an
exchange voluntarily effected on both sides? Do you not perceive,
moreover, that the man who borrows capital, being free
either to borrow it or not, will refuse to do so unless he sees it to
be for his advantage, and that the loan cannot make his situation
worse? The question he asks himself is evidently this: Will the
employment of this capital afford me advantages which are more
than sufficient to make up for the conditions which are demanded
of me? Or this: Is the effort which I am now obliged to make,
in order to obtain a given satisfaction, greater or less than the sum
of the efforts which the loan will entail upon me—first of all, in
rendering the <em class="e000I2">services</em> which are demanded of me by the lender,
and afterwards in procuring the special satisfaction I have in view
with the aid of the capital borrowed? If, taking all things into
account, there be no advantage to be got, he will not borrow, he
will remain as he is, and what injury is done him? He may be
mistaken, you will say. Undoubtedly he may. One may be mistaken
in all imaginable transactions. Are we then to abandon our
liberty? If you go that length, tell us what we are to substitute
for free will and free consent. Constraint? for if we give up
liberty, what remains but constraint? No, you say—the judgment
of a third party. Granted, on these conditions: First, that
the decision of this third party, whatever name you give him, shall
not be put in force by constraint. Secondly, that he be infallible,
for to substitute one fallible man for another would be to no purpose;
and the parties whose judgment I should least distrust in
such a matter are the parties who are interested in the result.
The third and last condition is, that this arbitrator shall not be
paid for his services; for it would be a singular way of manifesting
his sympathy for the borrower, first of all to take away from him
his liberty, and then to lay on his shoulders an additional burden
as the recompense of this philanthropical service. But let us leave
the question of right, and return to Political Economy.</p>

<p>A Capital which is composed of materials, provisions, and
instruments, presents two aspects—Utility and Value. I must
have failed in my exposition of the theory of value, if the reader
does not understand that the man who transfers capital is paid
only for its <em class="e000I2">value</em>, that is to say, for the service rendered in
<a id="p200" class="xxpn">[p200]</a> creating that capital; in other words, for the pains taken by the <em class="e000I2">cédant</em>
combined with the pains saved to the recipient. Capital consists
of commodities or products. It assumes the name of capital only
by reason of its ulterior destination. It is a great mistake to
suppose that capital, as such, is a thing having an independent
existence. A sack of corn is still a sack of corn, although one
man sells it for revenue, and another buys it for capital. Exchange
takes place on the invariable principle of value for value,
service for service; and the portion of gratuitous utility which
enters into the commodity is so much into the bargain. At the
same time, the portion which is gratuitous has no value, and value
is the only thing regarded in bargains. In this respect, transactions
which have reference to capital are in no respect different
from others.</p>

<p>This consideration opens up some admirable views with reference
to the social order, but which I cannot do more than indicate
here. Man, in a state of isolation, is possessed of capital only
when he has brought together materials, provisions, and tools.
The same thing does not hold true of man in the social state. It
is enough for the latter to have rendered <em class="e000I2">services</em>, and to have thus
the power of drawing upon society, by means of the mechanism
of exchange, for equivalent services. I mean by the mechanism
of exchange, money, bills, bank-notes, and even bankers themselves.
Whoever has rendered a <em class="e000I2">service</em>, and has not yet received
the corresponding <em class="e000I2">satisfaction</em>, is the bearer of a warrant, either
possessed of value, as money, or fiduciary, like bank-notes, which
warrant gives him the power of receiving back from society, when
he will, where he will, and in what form he will, an equivalent
<em class="e000I2">service</em>. This impairs neither in principle, nor in effect, nor in an
equitable point of view, the great law which I seek to elucidate,
that <em class="e000I2">services are exchanged for services</em>. It is still the embryo
barter, which has been developed, enlarged, and rendered more
complex, but without losing its identity.</p>

<p>The bearer of such a warrant as I have just described may then
demand back from society, at pleasure, either an immediate satisfaction,
or an object which, in another aspect, may be regarded as
capital. The person who lends or transfers has nothing to do
with that. He satisfies himself as to the <em class="e000I2">equivalence of the services</em>—that
is all.</p>

<p>Again, he may transfer this warrant to another, to use it as he
pleases, under the double condition of <em class="e000I2">restitution</em>, and of a <em class="e000I2">service</em>,
at a fixed date. If we go to the bottom of the matter, we shall
find that in this case the person who lends or transfers capital
<a id="p201" class="xxpn">[p201]</a> <em class="e000I2">deprives himself</em>, in favour of the cessionary or recipient, either of
an immediate satisfaction, which he defers for some years, or of
an instrument of labour which would have increased his power of
production, procured him the co-operation of natural agents, and
augmented, to his profit, the proportion of satisfactions to efforts.
He strips himself of these advantages, in order to invest another
with them. This is undoubtedly to render a <em class="e000I2">service</em>, and in equity
this service is entitled to a return. Mere restitution at the year’s
end cannot be considered as the remuneration of this special service.
Observe that the transaction here is not a sale, where the
delivery of the thing sold is immediate, and the return or remuneration
is immediate also. What we have to do with here is delay.
And this delay is <em class="e000I2">in itself</em> a special service, seeing that it imposes
a sacrifice on the person who accords it, and confers an advantage
on the person who asks for it. There must, then, be remuneration,
or we must give up that supreme law of society, <em class="e000I2">service for service</em>.
This remuneration is variously denominated, according to circumstances—<em class="e000I2">hire</em>,
<em class="e000I2">rent</em>, yearly <em class="e000I2">income</em>—but its generic name is
<em class="e000I2">Interest</em>.<a
href="#FN_51" id="FNa_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>Every <em class="e000I2">service</em> then is, or may become, a Capital, an admirable
phenomenon due to the mechanism of exchange. If workmen are
to commence the construction of a railway ten years hence, we
could not at the present moment store up in kind the corn which
is to feed them, the stuff which is to clothe them, and the barrows
and implements of which they will have need during that protracted
operation. But we can save up and transmit to them
the <em class="e000I2">value</em> of these things. For this purpose it is enough that we
render present services to society, and obtain for these services
the warrants, in money or credits of which I have spoken, which
can be converted into corn or cloth ten years hence. It is not
even necessary that we should leave these warrants dormant and
unproductive in the interval. There are merchants, bankers, and
others in society who, for the use of our services or their results,
render us the service of imposing upon themselves these privations
in our place.</p>

<p>And it is still more remarkable that we can effect an inverse
operation, however impossible at first sight this may appear. We
can convert into instruments of labour, into railways, into houses, a
capital which as yet has no existence—thus making available at
once <em class="e000I2">services</em> which will not be actually rendered till the twentieth
century. There are bankers who are ready to make present
advances on the faith that workmen and railway travellers of the
<a id="p202" class="xxpn">[p202]</a> third and fourth generation will provide for their payment, and
these drafts upon the future are transmitted from hand to hand,
without remaining for a moment unproductive. I confess I do
not believe that the numerous inventors of artificial societies ever
imagined anything at once so simple and so complex, so ingenious
and so equitable, as this. They would at once abandon their
insipid and stupid utopias if they but knew the fine harmonies of
the social mechanism which has been instituted by God. It was
a king of Aragon who bethought him what advice he should have
given to Providence on the construction of the celestial mechanism,
had he been called to the counsels of Omniscience. Newton never
conceived so impious a thought.</p>

<p>We thus see that all transmissions of services from one point of
time or of space to another repose upon this datum, that <em class="e000I2">to accord
delay is to render service</em>; in other words, they repose on the
legitimacy of Interest. The man who, in our days, has wished to
suppress interest, does not see that he would bring back exchange
to its embryo form,—barter, present barter,—without reference
either to the future or the past. He does not see that, imagining
himself the most advanced, he is in reality the most retrograde
of men, since he would reconstruct society on its most primitive
model. He desires, he says, <em class="e000I2">mutuality of services</em>. But he begins
by taking away the character of <em class="e000I2">services</em> exactly from that kind of
<em class="e000I2">services</em> which unite, tie together, and <em class="e000I2">solidarize</em> all places and all
times. In spite of the practical audacity of his socialist aphorisms,
he has paid an involuntary homage to the present order of things.
He has but one reform, which is negative. It consists in suppressing
in society the most powerful and marvellous part of its
machinery.</p>

<p>I have explained in another place the <em class="e000I2">legitimacy</em> and <em class="e000I2">perpetuity</em>
of Interest. I shall content myself at present with reminding the
reader—</p>

<p>1<em class="e000I2">st</em>, That the legitimacy of interest rests upon the fact that he
who <em class="e000I2">accords delay renders service</em>. Interest, then, is legitimate in
virtue of the principle of <em class="e000I2">service for service</em>.</p>

<p>2<em class="e000I2">d</em>, That the perpetuity of interest reposes on this other fact,
that <em class="e000I2">he who borrows must pay back all that he has borrowed at a fixed
date</em>. When the thing lent, or its value, is restored to its owner,
he can lend it anew. When returned to him a second time, he
can lend it a third time, and so on to <em class="e000I2">perpetuity</em>. Which of
the successive and voluntary borrowers can find fault with
this?</p>

<p>But since the legitimacy of interest has been contested so
<a id="p203" class="xxpn">[p203]</a> seriously in our day as to put capital to flight, or force it to conceal
itself, I may be permitted to show how utterly foolish and
insensate this controversy is.</p>

<p>And, first of all, let me ask, would it not be absurd and unjust
either that no remuneration should be given for the use of capital,
or that that remuneration should be the same, whether the loan
were granted and obtained at one year’s, or two years’, or ten
years’ date. If, unhappily, under this doctrine of pretended
<em class="e000I2">equality</em>, such a law should find a place in our code, an entire
category of human transactions would be suppressed on the
instant. We should still have <em class="e000I2">barter</em>, and <em class="e000I2">sales for ready money</em>,
but we could no longer have sales on credit, nor <em class="e000I2">loans</em>. The advocates
of equality would relieve borrowers from the burden of
paying interest; but they would, at the same time, balk them of
their loans. At the same rate, we might relieve men from the
inconvenient necessity of paying for what they buy. We should
only have to prohibit them from purchasing; or, what would come
to the same thing, declare <em class="e000I2">prices</em> illegal.</p>

<p>There is levelling enough, in all conscience, in this pretended
principle of equality. First of all, it would put a stop to the
creation of capital; for who would desire to save when he could
reap no advantage from saving? Then it would reduce wages to
zero, for where there is no capital (instruments, materials, and
provisions), there can be neither future work nor wages. We
should very soon arrive at the most perfect of all equalities, the
equality of nothingness.</p>

<p>But is there any man so blind as not to see that delay is <em class="e000I2">in itself</em>
a circumstance which is <em class="e000I2">onerous</em>, and, consequently, entitled to
remuneration? Apart, even, from the consideration of loans, would
not every one endeavour to abridge delays? It is the object of
our perpetual solicitude. Every employer of workmen lays great
stress on the time which must elapse before his returns come in.
He sells dearer or cheaper according as his returns are more or
less distant. Were he indifferent on that subject, he must forget
that capital is power; for if he is alive to that consideration, he
must naturally desire that it should perform its work in the shortest
possible time, so as to enable him the oftener to engage it in a new
operation.</p>

<p>They are but short-sighted Economists who think that we pay
interest for capital only when we borrow it. The general rule is,
that he who reaps the satisfaction should bear all the charges of
production, <em class="e000I2">delay included</em>, whether he renders the service to himself,
or has it rendered to him by another. A man in a state of
<a id="p204" class="xxpn">[p204]</a> isolation, who has no bargains or transactions with any one, would
consider it an <em class="e000I2">onerous</em> circumstance to be deprived of the use of his
weapons for a year. Why, then, should an analogous circumstance
not be considered as onerous in society? But if a man submits to
it voluntarily for the sake of another who agrees voluntarily to
remunerate it, what should render that remuneration illegitimate?</p>

<p>Nothing would be transacted in the world; no enterprise requiring
advances would be undertaken; we should neither plant, nor
sow, nor labour, were not delay considered as <em class="e000I2">in itself</em> an <em class="e000I2">onerous</em>
circumstance, and treated and paid for as such. Universal
consent is so unanimous on this point, that no exchange takes
place but on this principle. Delays, hindrances, enter into the
appreciation of <em class="e000I2">services</em>, and, consequently, into the constitution of
<em class="e000I2">value</em>.</p>

<p>Thus, in their crusade against interest, the advocates of equality
not only trample under foot the most obvious notions of equity—they
ignore not only their own principle of <em class="e000I2">service for service</em>,
but also the authority of mankind and universal practice. How
can they, in the face of day, exhibit the overweening pride which
such a pretension supposes? Is it not, indeed, a very strange and
a very sad thing, that these sectaries should adopt not only
tacitly, but often in so many words, the motto, that, since the
beginning of the world, all men have been mistaken except themselves?
<em class="e000I2">Omnes, ego non.</em></p>

<p>Pardon me for thus insisting on the legitimacy of interest, which
is founded on this principle, that, <em class="e000I2">since delay is costly, it must be
paid for</em>—to <em class="e000I2">cost</em> and to <em class="e000I2">pay</em> being correlative terms. The fault
lies in the spirit of our age. It is quite necessary to defend vital
truths, admitted generally by mankind, but attacked and brought
into question by a few fanatical innovators. For a writer who
aspires to demonstrate the harmony of phenomena in the aggregate,
it is a painful thing, you may believe, to be constantly stopped by
the necessity of elucidating the most elementary notions. Would
Laplace have been able to explain the planetary system in all its
simplicity, if, among his readers, there had not existed certain
common and received ideas,—if it had been necessary for him, in
order to prove that the earth turns upon its axis, to begin by
teaching numeration? Such is the hard fate of the Economist of
our day. If he neglects the rudiments, he is not understood—if
he explains them, the beauty and simplicity of his system is lost
sight of in the multiplicity of details.</p>

<p>It is a happy thing for mankind that <em class="e000I2">Interest</em> can be shown to
be legitimate. We should otherwise be placed in a miserable
<a id="p205" class="xxpn">[p205]</a> dilemma—we must either perish by remaining just, or make progress
by means of injustice.</p>

<p>Every branch of industry is an aggregate of Efforts. But, as
regards efforts, there is an important distinction to be made. Some
efforts are connected with services which we are presently engaged
in rendering; others with an indefinite series of analogous services.
Let me explain myself.</p>

<p>The day’s work of the water-carrier must be paid for by those
who profit by his labour. But his anterior labour in making his
barrow and his water-cask must, as regards remuneration, be
spread over an indeterminate number of consumers.</p>

<p>In the same way, ploughing, sowing, harrowing, weeding, cutting
down, thrashing, apply only to the present harvest; but clearing,
enclosing, draining, building, improving, apply to and facilitate an
indefinite number of future harvests.</p>

<p>According to the general law of <em class="e000I2">service for service</em>, those who
receive the ultimate satisfaction must recompense the efforts which
have been made for them. As regards the first class of efforts,
there is no difficulty. They are bargained for and <em class="e000I2">estimated</em> by
the man who makes them, and the man who profits by them. But
how are those of the second class to be <em class="e000I2">estimated</em>? How is a just
proportion of the permanent advances, the general costs, and what
the Economists term fixed capital, to be spread over the whole
series of satisfactions which they are destined to realize? By
what process can we distribute the burden among those to whom
the water is furnished down to the time when the barrow shall be
worn out, and among all the consumers of corn until the period
when the field will produce no more?</p>

<p>I know not how they would resolve this problem in Icarie, or
at the Phalanstère.<a
href="#FN_52" id="FNa_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> But I am inclined to think that the gentlemen
who manufacture artificial societies, and who are so fertile
in arrangements and expedients, and so prompt to compel their
adoption by Law (or constraint), could imagine no solution more
ingenious than the very natural process which men have adopted
since the beginning of the world, and which it is now sought to
prohibit them from following. Here is the process—it flows from
the law of <em class="e000I2">Interest</em>.</p>

<p>Suppose a thousand francs to be laid out on agricultural
improvements, the rate of interest to be five per cent., and the
average return fifty hectolitres of corn. In these circumstances,
each hectolitre would be burdened with one franc. <a id="p206" class="xxpn">[p206]</a></p>

<p>This franc is obviously the legitimate recompense of an actual
<em class="e000I2">service</em>, rendered by the proprietor (whom we might term a
labourer), as well to the person who shall acquire a hectolitre of
corn ten years hence as to the man who buys it to-day. The law
of strict justice, then, is observed here.</p>

<p>But if the agricultural improvement, or the barrow and the
water-barrel, have only a limited duration, which we can appreciate
approximately, a sinking fund must be added to the interest, in
order that, when these portions of capital are worn out, the proprietor
may be enabled to renew them. Still it is the law of justice
which governs the transaction.</p>

<p>We must not suppose, however, that the franc with which each
hectolitre is burdened as interest is an invariable quantity. It
represents a value, and is subject to the law of values. It rises
or falls with the variation of supply and demand,—that is to say,
according to the exigencies of the times and the interests of
society.</p>

<p>It is generally thought that this species of remuneration has a
tendency to rise, if not in the case of manufacturing, at least in the
case of agricultural improvements. Supposing this rent to have
been equitable at the beginning, it has a tendency, it is said, to
degenerate into abuse; because the proprietor, sitting with his
hands across, sees it increase year after year, solely in consequence
of the increase of population and the enlarged demand for corn.</p>

<p>I allow that this tendency exists, but it is not peculiar to the
rent of land,—it is common to all departments of industry. In
all, value increases with the density of population, and even the
common day-labourer earns more in Paris than he could in
Brittany.</p>

<p>And then, as regards the rent of land, the tendency to which we
have referred is powerfully counterbalanced by another tendency—that
of progress. An amelioration, realized at the present day by
improved processes, effected with less manual labour, and at a time
when the rate of interest has fallen, saves our paying too dearly
for improvements effected in former times. The fixed capital of
the landed proprietor, like that of the manufacturer, is deteriorated
in the long-run by the invention of instruments of equal value and
greater efficiency. This is a magnificent Law, which overturns
the melancholy theory of Ricardo; and it will be explained more
in detail when we come to the subject of landed property.</p>

<p>Observe, that the problem of the distribution of the services
which form the remuneration of permanent improvements can be
resolved only by a reference to the law of <em class="e000I2">interest</em>. The capital
<a id="p207" class="xxpn">[p207]</a> itself cannot be spread over a succession of purchasers, for this is
rendered impossible by their indeterminate number. The first
would pay for the last, which would be unjust. Besides, a time
would arrive when the proprietor would become possessed both of
the capital laid out in the improvement, and of the improvement
itself, which would be equally unfair. Let us acknowledge, then,
that the natural mechanism of society is too ingenious to require
the substitution of artificial contrivances.</p>

<p>I have presented the phenomenon in its simplest form, in order
to render it intelligible; but, in practice, things do not take place
quite as I have described them.</p>

<p>The proprietor does not regulate the distribution himself, or
determine that each hectolitre shall be charged with one franc,
more or less, as in the hypothetical case which I have put. He
finds an established order of things, as well with reference to the
average price of corn as to the rate of interest. Upon these data
he decides how he shall invest his capital. He will devote it to
agricultural improvements, if he finds that the average price of
corn will return him the ordinary rate of interest. If not, he will
devote his capital to a more lucrative branch of industry—a branch
of industry which, just because it is more lucrative, presents,
happily for society, greater attractions for capital. This movement
of capital from one department to another, which is what actually
takes place, tends to the same result, and presents us with another
Harmony.</p>

<p>The reader will understand that I confine myself to a special
instance only for the sake of elucidating a general law, which
applies to all trades and professions.</p>

<p>A lawyer, for example, cannot expect, from the first suit of
which he happens to have charge, to be reimbursed the expense
of his education, of his course of probation, of his establishment in
business, which we may suppose to amount to 20,000 francs. Not
only would this be unjust—it would be impracticable; for were
he to make such a stipulation, his first brief would never make its
appearance, and our Cujacius would be obliged to imitate the gentleman
who, on taking up house, could get nobody to come to his first
ball, and declared that next year he would begin with his second.</p>

<p>The same thing holds with the merchant, the physician, the shipowner,
the artist. In every career we encounter these two classes
of efforts—the second imperatively requires to be spread over an
indeterminate number of consumers, employers, or customers, and
it is impossible to imagine such a distribution without reference to
the mechanism of <em class="e000I2">interest</em>. <a id="p208" class="xxpn">[p208]</a></p>

<p>Great efforts have been made of late to remove the hatred which
exists in the popular mind against capital,—infamous, infernal
capital, as it is called. It has been exhibited to the masses as a
voracious and insatiable monster, more destructive than cholera,
more frightful than revolution, exercising on the body politic the
action of a vampire, whose power of suction goes on increasing
indefinitely. <em class="e000I2">Vires acquirit eundo.</em> The tongue of this blood-sucker
is called usury, revenue, hire, rent, interest. A writer, who might
have acquired reputation by his great powers, and who has preferred
to gain notoriety by his paradoxes, has been pleased to
scatter these paradoxes among a people already in the delirium of
a revolutionary fever. I, too, have an apparent paradox to submit
to the reader; and I beg him to examine it, and see whether it be
not in reality a great and consoling truth.</p>

<p>But, first, I must say a word as to the manner in which M.
Proudhon and his school explain what they term the illegitimacy
of <em class="e000I2">interest</em>.</p>

<p>Capital is an instrument of labour. The use of instruments of
labour is to procure us the co-operation of the <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> forces of
nature. By the steam-engine we avail ourselves of the elasticity
of air; by the watch-spring, of the elasticity of steel; by weights
or waterfalls, of gravitation; by the voltaic pile, of the rapidity
of the electric spark; by the sun’s rays, of the chemical and physical
combinations which we call vegetation, etc., etc. Now, by
confounding Utility with Value, we suppose that these natural
agents possess a value <em class="e000I2">which is inherent in them</em>; and that, consequently,
those who appropriate them are paid for their use, inasmuch
as value implies payment. We imagine that products are
burdened with one item for the services of man, which we admit
to be just; and with another item for the services of nature, which
we reject as iniquitous. Why, it is asked, should we pay for
gravitation, electricity, vegetable life, elasticity, and so forth?</p>

<p>The answer to this question is to be found in the theory of <em class="e000I2">value</em>.
Those Socialists who take the name of <em class="e000I2">Égalitaires</em> confound the
legitimate <em class="e000I2">value</em> of the instrument, which is the offspring of human
labour, with its useful result, which, under deduction of that
legitimate value, or of the interest which represents it, is always
gratuitous. When I remunerate an agricultural labourer, a miller,
a railway company, I give nothing, absolutely nothing, for the
phenomena of vegetation, gravitation, or the elasticity of steam.
I pay for the human labour required for making the instruments
by means of which these forces are constrained to act; or, what
suits my purpose better, I pay interest for that labour. I render
<a id="p209" class="xxpn">[p209]</a> service for service, by means of which the useful action of these
forces is turned gratuitously to my profit. It is the same thing as
in the case of Exchange, or simple barter. The presence of capital
does not at all modify this law, for capital is nothing else than an
accumulation of values, of <em class="e000I2">services</em>, to which is committed the
special duty of procuring the co-operation of nature.</p>

<p>And now for my paradox.</p>

<p>Of all the elements of which the total value of any product is
made up, the part which we should pay for most cheerfully is that
element which we term the interest of the advances, or capital.</p>

<p>And why? Because that element enables us, by paying for
<em class="e000I2">one</em>, to save <em class="e000I2">two</em>. Because, by its very presence, it shows clearly
that natural forces have concurred in the final result, without our
having had to pay for their co-operation; and the consequence is,
that the same general utility is placed at our disposal, while at the
same time a certain portion of gratuitous utility has, happily for
us, been substituted for onerous utility; and, in short, the price of
the product has been reduced. We acquire it with a less proportion
of our own labour, and, what happens to society at large, is
just what would happen to an isolated individual who should succeed
in realizing an ingenious invention.</p>

<p>Suppose the case of a common artisan, who earns four francs
a-day. With two francs,—that is to say, with half-a-day’s labour,
he purchases a pair of cotton stockings. Were he to try to procure
these stockings by his own direct labour, I sincerely believe
that his whole life would not suffice for the work. How, then,
does it happen that his half-day’s work pays for all the <em class="e000I2">human
services</em> which have been rendered to him on this occasion? According
to the law of <em class="e000I2">service for service</em>, why is he not forced to
give several years’ labour?</p>

<p>For this reason, that the stockings are the result of <em class="e000I2">human
services</em>, of which natural agents, by the intervention of Capital,
have enormously diminished the proportion. Our artisan, however,
pays not only for the actual labour of all those who have
concurred in the work, but also the interest of the capital by
means of which the co-operation of nature was procured; and it is
worthy of remark, that, without this last remuneration, or were it
held to be illegitimate, capital would not have been employed to
secure the assistance of the natural agents. There would have
been in the product only onerous utility; for in that case the
commodity would have been the exclusive result of human labour,
and our artisan would have been brought back to the point whence
he started,—that is to say, he would have been placed in the
<a id="p210" class="xxpn">[p210]</a> dilemma of either dispensing with the stockings, or of paying for
them the price of several years’ labour.</p>

<p>If our artisan had learnt to analyze phenomena, he would soon
get reconciled to Capital, on seeing how much he is indebted to
it. He would be convinced, above all, that the gratuitous nature
of the gifts of God has been completely preserved, and that these
gifts have been lavished on him with a liberality which he owes
not to his own merit, but to the beautiful mechanism of the <em class="e000I2">natural</em>
social order. Capital does not consist in the vegetative force which
has made cotton germinate and flower, but in the <em class="e000I2">pains taken</em> by
the planter. Capital is not the wind which fills the sails of the
ship, or the magnetism which acts upon the needle, but the <em class="e000I2">pains
taken</em> by the sailmaker and the optician. Capital is not the elasticity
of steam which turns the spindles of the mill, but the <em class="e000I2">pains
taken</em> by the machine-maker. Vegetation, the power of the winds,
magnetism, elasticity,—all these are purely gratuitous; and hence
the stockings have so little value. As regards the pains taken by
the planter, the sailmaker, the optician, the shipbuilder, the sailor,
the manufacturer, the merchant, they are spread—or, rather, so far
as capital is concerned, the interest of that capital is spread—over
innumerable purchasers of stockings; and this is the reason why
the portion of labour given by each of these purchasers is so small.</p>

<p>Modern reformers! when I see you desiring to replace this
admirable natural order by an arrangement of your own invention,
there are two things (although they are in reality one
and the same) which confound me,—namely, your want of faith
in Providence, and your faith in yourselves—your ignorance, and
your presumption.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>It follows from what I have said that the progress of mankind
coincides with the rapid creation of Capital; for to say that new
capital is formed, is just to say, in other words, that obstacles,
formerly onerously combated by labour, are now gratuitously combated
by nature; and that, be it observed, not for the profit of the
capitalist, but for the profit of the community.</p>

<p>This being so, the paramount interest of all (in an economical
point of view, and rightly understood) is to favour the rapid creation
of capital. But capital, if I may say so, increases of its own
accord under the triple influence of activity, frugality, and security.
We can scarcely exercise any direct influence on the activity and
frugality of our neighbours, except through the medium of public
opinion, by an intelligent communication of our antipathies and
our sympathies. But as regards security we can do much, for,
<a id="p211" class="xxpn">[p211]</a> without security, capital, far from being formed and accumulated,
conceals itself, takes flight, and perishes; and this shows us how
suicidal that popular ardour is which displays itself in disturbing
the public tranquillity. Let the working-classes be well assured
that the mission of Capital from the beginning has been to set men
free from the yoke of ignorance, of want, and of despotism; and
that to frighten away Capital is to rivet a triple chain on the
energies of the human race.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">vires acquirit eundo</em> may be applied with rigorous exactitude
to capital, and its beneficent influence. Capital, when formed,
necessarily leaves disposable both labour and the remuneration of
that labour. It carries in itself, then, a power of progression.
There is in it something which resembles the law of velocities.
This progression economical science has omitted hitherto to oppose
to the other progression which Malthus has remarked. It is a
Harmony which we cannot explain in this place, but must reserve
for the chapter on Population.</p>

<p>But I must here put the reader on his guard against a specious
objection. If the mission of capital, it may be said, is to cause
nature to execute work which has been hitherto executed by
human labour, whatever good it may confer upon mankind, it
must do injury to the working-classes, especially to those classes
who live by wages; for everything which throws hands out of
employment, and renders them disposable, renders competition
more intense; and this, undoubtedly, is the secret reason of the
antipathy of the working-classes to men of capital. If this objection
were well founded, we should have a discordant note in the
social harmony.</p>

<p>The illusion arises from losing sight of this, that <em class="e000I2">capital, in
proportion as its action is extended, sets free and renders disposable
a certain amount of human efforts, only by setting free and rendering
disposable a corresponding fund of remuneration</em>, so that these two
elements meet and compensate one another. The labour is not
paralyzed. Replaced in a special department of industry by
gratuitous forces, it sets to work upon other obstacles in the
general march of progress, and with more certainty, inasmuch as
it finds its recompense prepared beforehand.</p>

<p>Recurring to our former illustration, it is easy to see that the
price of stockings (like that of books, and all things else) is lowered
by the action of capital, only by leaving in the hands of the purchaser
a part of the former price. This is too clear for illustration.
The workman who now pays two francs for what he paid six francs
for formerly, has four francs left at his disposal. Now, it is exactly
<a id="p212" class="xxpn">[p212]</a> in that proportion that human labour has been replaced by natural
forces. These forces, then, are a pure and simple acquisition,
which alters in no respect the relation of labour to available
remuneration. It will be remembered that the answer to this
objection was given formerly,<a
href="#FN_53" id="FNa_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> when, observing upon man in a
state of isolation, or reduced once more to the primitive law of
barter, I put the reader on his guard against the illusion which it
is my object here to dispel.</p>

<p>We may leave capital, then, to take care of itself, to be created
and accumulated according to its own proper tendencies, and the
wants and desires of men. Do not imagine that, when the common
labourer economizes for his old days, when the father of a family
sets his son up in business, or provides a dower for his daughter,
they are exercising to the detriment of the public that noble attribute
of man, Foresight; but it would be so, and private virtues
would be in direct antagonism with the general good, were there
an incompatibility between Capital and Labour.</p>

<p>Far from mankind being subjected to this contradiction, or, I
might rather say, this impossibility (for how can we conceive progressive
evil in the aggregate to result from progressive good
in individual cases?) we must acknowledge that Providence, in
justice and mercy, has assigned a nobler part to Labour than to
Capital in the work of progress, and has afforded a stimulant
more efficacious, a recompense more liberal, to the man who lives
by the sweat of his brow, than to the man who subsists upon the
exertions of his forefathers.</p>

<p>In fact, having established that every increase of capital is
followed by a necessary increase of general prosperity, I venture
to lay down the following principle with reference to the distribution
of wealth,—a principle which I believe will be found unassailable:—</p>

<p>“<em class="e000I2">In proportion to the increase of Capital,
the</em> absolute <em class="e000I2">share of the total
product falling to the capitalist is augmented, and his</em>
relative <em class="e000I2">share is diminished; while, on the
contrary, the labourer’s share is increased both absolutely and
relatively.</em>”</p>

<p>I shall explain this more clearly by figures:—</p>

<p>Suppose the total products of society, at successive epochs, to be
represented by the figures 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, etc.</p>

<p>I maintain that the share falling to the capitalists will
descend, successively, from 50 per cent., to 40, 35, 30 per cent.,
and that the share of the labourers will rise, consequently,
from 50 per cent., to 60, 65, 70 per cent.,—so that the <em
class="e000I2">absolute</em> share of the <a id="p213"
class="xxpn">[p213]</a> capitalist will be always greater at each
period, although his <em class="e000I2">relative</em> share will be
smaller.</p>

<p>The division will take place in this way,—</p>

<div class="tablebox"><div class="tableinline">
<table summary="share of society's products falling
to capitalists and labourers">
<tr>
 <td></td>
 <th>Total<br />Product.</th>

 <td class="right">2800</td></tr>
</table></div></div>

<p>Such is the great, admirable, reassuring, necessary, and <em class="e000I2">inflexible</em>
law of Capital. To demonstrate it, appears to me to be the
true way to strike with discredit the declamations which have so
long been dinned into our ears against the <em class="e000I2">avidity</em>, the <em class="e000I2">tyranny</em>, of
the most powerful instrument of civilisation and of <em class="e000I2">equality</em> which
has ever proceeded from the human faculties.</p>

<p>The demonstration is twofold. First of all, we must prove that
the <em class="e000I2">relative</em> share of the product falling to the capitalist goes on
continually diminishing. This is not difficult; for it only amounts
to saying that <em class="e000I2">the more abundant capital becomes, the more interest
falls</em>. Now, this is a matter of fact, incontestable and uncontested.
Not only does science explain it—it is self-evident. Schools the
most eccentric admit it. It forms the basis of their theory, for it is
from this very fall of interest that they infer the necessary, the
inevitable annihilation of what they choose to brand as <em class="e000I2">infernal</em>
Capital. Now, say they, inasmuch as this annihilation is necessary,
is inevitable, and must take place in a given time; and,
moreover, implies the realization of a positive good, it is incumbent
on us to hasten it and insure it. I am not concerned to refute
these principles, or the deductions drawn from them. It is enough
that Economists of all schools, as well as socialists, <em class="e000I2">egalitaires</em>, and
others, all admit, in point of fact, that interest falls in proportion
as capital becomes more abundant. Whether they admit it or not,
indeed, the fact is not the less certain. It rests upon the authority
of universal experience, and on the acquiescence, involuntary it
may be, of all the capitalists in the world. It is a fact that the
interest of capital is lower in Spain than in Mexico, in France
than in Spain, in England than in France, in Holland than in
England. Now, when interest falls from 20 to 15 per cent., and
then to 10, to 8, to 6, to 5, to 4½, to 4, to 3½, to 3 per cent., what
does that mean in relation to the question which now engages us?
It means that capital, as the recompense of its co-operation in the
work of production, in the realization of wealth, is content, or, if
you will, is forced to be content, with a smaller and smaller share
of the product in proportion as capital increases. Does it constitute
one-third of the value of corn, of cloth, of houses, of ships, of
<a id="p214" class="xxpn">[p214]</a> canals? in other words, when these things are sold, does one-third
of the price fall to the capitalist, and two-thirds to the labourer?
By degrees, the capitalist receives no more than a fourth, a fifth,
a sixth. His <em class="e000I2">relative</em> share goes on diminishing, while that of the
labourer goes on increasing in the same proportion; and the first
part of my demonstration is complete.</p>

<p>It remains for me to prove that the <em class="e000I2">absolute</em> share falling to the
capitalist goes on constantly increasing. It is very true that the
tendency of interest is to fall. But when, and why? When, and
because, the capital becomes more abundant. It is then quite
possible that the total product should be increased while the <em class="e000I2">percentage</em>
is diminished. A man has a larger income with 200,000
francs at four per cent., than with 100,000 francs at five per cent.,
although, in the first case, he charges less to the manufacturer for
the use of his capital. The same thing holds of a nation, and of
the world at large. Now, I maintain that the <em class="e000I2">percentage</em>, in its
tendency to fall, neither does nor can follow a progression so rapid
that the <em class="e000I2">sum total</em> of interest should be smaller when capital is
abundant than when it is scarce. I admit, indeed, that if the
capital of mankind be represented by 100 and interest by 5,—this
interest will amount to no more than 4 when the capital
shall have mounted to 200. Here we see the simultaneousness of
the two effects. The less the <em class="e000I2">relative</em> part, the greater the <em class="e000I2">absolute</em>
part. But my hypothesis does not admit that the increase of
capital from 100 to 200 is sufficient to make interest fall from 5
to 2 per cent., for example; because, if it were so, the capitalist
who had an income of 5000 francs with 100,000 francs of capital,
would have no greater income than 4000 francs with 200,000
francs of capital. A result so contradictory and impossible, an
anomaly so strange, would be met with the simplest and most
agreeable of remedies; for then, in order to increase your income,
it would only be necessary to consume half your capital. A
happy and whimsical age it would be when men could enrich by
impoverishing themselves!</p>

<p>We must take care, then, not to lose sight of the combination
of these two correlative facts. The increase of capital, and the
fall of interest, take place <em class="e000I2">necessarily</em> in such a way that the total
product is continually augmented.</p>

<p>And let us remark in passing, that this completely exposes the
fallacy of those who imagine that because interest falls, it tends
to annihilation. The effect of that would be, that a time would
arrive when capital would be so much increased as to yield
nothing to its possessors. Keep your mind easy on that score—before
<a id="p215" class="xxpn">[p215]</a> that time comes, capitalists will dissipate the stock in
order to ensure the reappearance of interest.</p>

<p>Such is the great law of Capital and Labour in what concerns
the distribution of the product of their joint agency. Each of
them has a greater and greater <em class="e000I2">absolute</em> share, but the <em class="e000I2">proportional</em>
share of the capitalist is continually diminished as compared with
that of the labourers.</p>

<p>Cease, then, capitalists and workmen, to regard each other with
an eye of envy and distrust. Shut your ears against those absurd
declamations which proceed from ignorance and presumption,
which, under pretence of insuring future prosperity, blow the
flame of present discord. Be assured that your interests are one
and identical; that they are indisputably knit together; that they
tend together towards the realization of the public good; that the
toils of the present generation mingle with the labours of generations
which are past; that all who co-operate in the work of production
receive their share of the produce; and that the most
ingenious and most equitable distribution is effected among you
by the wise laws of Providence, and under the empire of freedom,
independently altogether of a parasite sentimentalism, which would
impose upon you its decrees at the expense of your well-being,
your liberty, your security, and your self-respect.</p>

<p>Capital has its root in these attributes of man—Foresight, Intelligence,
and Frugality. To set about the creation of capital
we must look forward to the future, and sacrifice the present to it—we
must exercise a noble empire over ourselves and over our
appetites; we must resist the seduction of present enjoyments,
the impulses of vanity and the caprices of fashion and of public
opinion, always so indulgent to the thoughtless and the prodigal.
We must study cause and effect, in order to discover by what
processes, by what instruments, nature can be made to co-operate
in the work of production. We must be animated by love for
our families, and not grudge present sacrifices for the sake of
those who are dear to us, and who will reap the fruits after we
ourselves have disappeared from the scene. To create capital is
to prepare food, clothing, shelter, leisure, instruction, independence,
dignity, for future generations. Nothing of all this can be
effected without bringing into play motives which are eminently
social, and, what is more, converting these virtues into habits.</p>

<p>And yet it is very usual to attribute to capital a sort of fatal
efficacy, the effect of which is to introduce egotism, austerity,
Machiavelism, into the hearts of those who aspire to possess it.
But let us not be misunderstood. There are countries where
<a id="p216" class="xxpn">[p216]</a> labour is of little value, and the little that is earned is shared by
the government. In order to snatch from you the fruit of your
toil, what is called the State surrounds you with a multitude of
trammels. It interferes with all your actions, and mixes itself
up in all your concerns. It domineers over your mind and
your faith. It disarranges all interests, and places them in an
artificial and precarious position. It enervates individual energy
and activity, by usurping the direction of all affairs. It makes
the responsibility of actions fall upon people with whom it
amounts to nothing, so that by degrees all notions of what is just
or unjust are effaced. By its diplomacy it embroils the nation in
quarrels with all the world, and then the army and navy are
brought into play. It warps the popular mind as much as it can
upon all economical questions; for it is necessary to make the
masses believe that its foolish expenditure, its unjust aggressions,
its conquests, its colonies, are for them a source of riches. In
such countries it is difficult to create capital by natural means.
The great object is to purloin it by force or by fraud from those
who have created it. We there see men enriching themselves by
war, by places at court, by gambling, by purveying, by stockjobbing,
by commercial frauds, by hazardous enterprises, by public
contracts, etc. The qualities requisite for thus snatching
capital from the hands of those who create it are precisely the
opposite of those necessary for its formation. It cannot surprise
us, then, that in countries so situated an association is established
between these two ideas—<em class="e000I2">capital</em> and <em class="e000I2">egotism</em>; and this association
becomes ineradicable when all the moral ideas of the country
exhaust themselves on ancient and mediæval history.</p>

<p>But when we turn our regards, not to this abstraction and
abuse of capital, but to its creation by intelligence and activity,
foresight and frugality, it is impossible not to perceive that a
moral and social virtue is attached to its acquisition.</p>

<p>Nor is there less moral and social virtue in the action of capital
than in its formation. Its peculiar effect is to procure us the co-operation
of nature, to set us free from all that is most material,
muscular, brutal, in the work of production; to render the intelligent
principle more and more predominant; to enlarge the
domain, I do not say of idleness, but of leisure; to render less
imperious the physical wants of our nature, by rendering their
satisfaction more easy, and to substitute for them wants and
enjoyments of a nature more elevated, more delicate, more refined,
more artistic, more spiritual.</p>

<p>Thus, in whatever point of view we place ourselves, whether
<a id="p217" class="xxpn">[p217]</a> we regard Capital in connexion with our wants, which it ennobles;
with our efforts, which it facilitates; with our enjoyments, which
it purifies; with nature, which it enlists in our service; with
morality, which it converts into habit; with sociability, which it
develops; with equality, which it promotes; with freedom, in
which it lives; with equity, which it realizes by methods the
most ingenious—everywhere, always, provided that it is created
and acts in the regular order of things, and is not diverted from
its natural uses, we recognise in Capital what forms the indubitable
note and stamp of all great providential laws,—Harmony. <a id="p218" class="xxpn">[p218]</a></p>

<h2 title="VIII. Property-Community"><a id="VIII"></a>VIII.<br />
PROPERTY—COMMUNITY.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
Recognising in the soil, in natural agents, and in instruments of
labour, what they incontestably possess, the gift of engendering
Utility, I have endeavoured to denude them of what has been
erroneously attributed to them, namely, the faculty of creating
Value,—a faculty which pertains exclusively to the Services which
men exchange with each other.</p>

<p>This simple rectification, whilst it strengthens and confirms
Property, by restoring to it its true character, brings to light a
most important fact, hitherto, if I am not mistaken, overlooked
by Economic science—the fact that there exists a real, essential,
and <em class="e000I2">progressive</em> Community,—the natural result of every social
system in which liberty prevails, and the evident design of which
is to conduct all men, as brethren, from primitive Equality, which
is the equality of ignorance and destitution, towards an ultimate
Equality in the possession of truth and material prosperity.</p>

<p>If this radical distinction between the Utility of things and the
value of services be true in itself, and in the consequences which
have been deduced from it, it is impossible to misunderstand its
bearing; for it leads to nothing less than the absorption of utopian
theories in science, and the reconcilement of antagonistic schools
in a common faith, which satisfies all minds and all aspirations.</p>

<p>Men of Property and leisure!—whatever be your rank in the
social scale, whatever step of the social ladder you may have
reached by dint of activity, probity, order, and economy—whence
come the fears which have seized upon you? The perfumed but
poisoned breath of Utopia menaces your existence. You are
loudly told that the fortune you have amassed for the purpose of
securing a little repose in your old age, and food, instruction, and
an outset in life for your children, has been acquired by you at
the expense of your brethren; that you have placed yourselves
<a id="p219" class="xxpn">[p219]</a> between the gifts of God and the poor; that, like greedy tax-gatherers,
you have levied a tribute on those gifts, under the name
of Property, of Interest, and of Rent; that you have intercepted
the benefits which the common Father has bestowed on his
children, in order to make merchandise of them. You are called
upon for restitution; and what augments your terror is, that your
advocates, in conducting your defence, feel themselves too often
obliged to avow that the usurpation is flagrant, but that it is necessary.
Such accusations I meet with a direct and emphatic negative.
You have not intercepted the gifts of God. You have received
them gratuitously, it is true, at the hands of nature; but you have
also gratuitously transferred them to your brethren without receiving
anything. They have acted the same way towards you; and the
only things which have been reciprocally <em class="e000I2">compensated</em> are physical or
intellectual efforts, toils undergone, dangers braved, skill exercised,
privations submitted to, pains taken, <em class="e000I2">services rendered and received</em>.
You may perhaps have thought only of yourselves and your own
selfish interest, but that very selfish interest has been an instrument
in the hand of an infinitely prescient and wise Providence
to enlarge unceasingly among men the domain of Community;
for without your efforts all those <em class="e000I2">useful effects</em> which you have
obtained from nature, in order to distribute them without remuneration
among your brethren, would have remained for ever
inert. I say <em class="e000I2">without remuneration</em>, because what you have received
is simply the recompense of your efforts, and not at all the
price of the gifts of God. Live, then, in peace, without fear and
without misgiving. You have no other property in the world
but your right to services, in exchange for other services, by you
faithfully rendered, and by your brethren voluntarily accepted.
Such property is legitimate, unassailable; no Utopia can prevail
against it, for it enters into the very constitution of our being.
No theory can ever succeed in blighting or in shaking it.</p>

<p>Men of toil and privations! you cannot shut your eyes to this
truth, that the primitive condition of the human race is that of an
entire Community,—a perfect Equality,—of poverty, of destitution,
and of ignorance. Man redeems himself from this estate by the
sweat of his brow, and directs his course towards another Community,
that of the gifts of God, successively obtained with less
effort,—towards another Equality, that of material prosperity,
knowledge, and moral dignity. The progress of men on the road
of improvement is unequal, indeed; and you could not complain
were the more hurried and precipitate march of the vanguard of
progress to retard in some measure your own advance. But in
<a id="p220" class="xxpn">[p220]</a> truth it is quite the reverse. No ray of light penetrates a single
mind without in some degree enlightening yours. No step of
progress, prompted by the conscious possession of property, but is
a step of progress for you. No wealth is created which does not
tend to your enfranchisement; no capital, which does not increase
your enjoyments in proportion to your labour; no acquisition,
which does not increase your facilities of acquisition; no
Property, which does not tend to enlarge, for your benefit, the
domain of Community. The natural social order has been so
skillfully arranged by the Divine Architect, that those who are
more advanced on the road of civilisation hold out to you, voluntarily
or unconsciously, a helping hand; for the order of things
has been so disposed that no man can work honestly for himself
without at the same time working for all. And it is rigorously
true to affirm that every attack upon this marvellous order would
on your part be not only a homicide, but a suicide. Human nature
is an admirable chain, which exhibits this standing miracle, that
the first links communicate to all the others a progressive movement
more and more rapid, onwards to the last.</p>

<p>Men of philanthropy! lovers of equality! blind defenders,
dangerous friends of the suffering classes, who are yet far behind
on the road of civilisation, you who expect the reign of Community
in this world, why do you begin by unsettling all interests
and shaking all received opinions? Why, in your pride,
should you seek to subjugate men’s wills, and bring them under
the yoke of your social inventions? Do you not see that this
Community after which you sigh, and which is to inaugurate the
kingdom of God upon earth, has been already thought of and
provided for by God himself? Does He want your aid to provide
a patrimony for his children? Has He need either of your
conceptions or of your violence? Do you not see that this Community
is realized more and more every day, in virtue of His
admirable decrees; that for the execution of these decrees He has
not trusted to your chance services and puerile arrangements, nor
even to the growing expression of the sympathetic principle manifested
by charity; but that He has confided the realization of His
providential designs to the most active, the most personal, the
most permanent of all our energies—Self-interest,—a principle
imbedded in our inmost nature, and which never flags, never takes
rest? Study, then, the social mechanism as it comes from the
hand of the Great Mechanician, and you will find that it testifies
to a universal solicitude, which far outstrips your dreams and
chimeras. You will then, I hope, in place of presumptuously pretending
<a id="p221" class="xxpn">[p221]</a> to reconstruct the divine workmanship, be content to
admire and to bless it.</p>

<p>I say not that there is no room in this world of ours for reforms
and reformers. I say not that mankind are not to call to their
service, and encourage with their gratitude, men of investigation,
of science, and of earnestness,—hearts faithful to the people. Such
are still but too much wanted,—not to overturn the social laws,—but
to combat the artificial obstacles which disturb and reverse the
action of these laws. In truth, it is difficult to understand why
people should keep repeating such commonplaces as this: “Political
Economy is an optimist, as far as existing facts are concerned;
and affirms that whatever is is right. At the sight of what is evil,
as at the sight of what is good. Economists are content to exclaim,
<em class="e000I2">Laissez faire</em>.” Optimists with reference to existing facts! Then
we must be ignorant that the primitive condition of man is poverty,
ignorance, the reign of brute force! We must be ignorant that
the moving spring of human nature is aversion to all suffering, to
all fatigue; and that labour being fatigue, the earliest manifestation
of selfishness among men is shown in their effort to throw this painful
burden on the shoulders of each other! The words cannibalism,
war, slavery, privilege, monopoly, fraud, spoliation, imposture, must
either have never reached our ears, or else we must see in these
abominations the necessary machinery of progress! But is there
not in all this a certain amount of wilful misrepresentation, a confounding
of all things for the purpose of accusing us of confounding
them? When we admire the providential laws which govern
human transactions—when we assert that men’s interests are harmonious—when
we thence conclude that they naturally tend and
gravitate towards the realization of relative equality and general
progress—it is surely from the play and action of these laws, not
from their perturbations and disturbances, that we educe harmony.
When we say <em class="e000I2">laissez faire</em>, we surely mean, <em class="e000I2">allow these laws to act</em>,
not, <em class="e000I2">allow these laws to be disturbed</em>. According as we conform to
these laws or violate them, good or evil is produced; in other
words, men’s interests are in harmony, provided right prevail, and
services are freely and voluntarily exchanged against services.
But does this imply that we are ignorant of the perpetual struggle
of Wrong against Right? Does this imply that we lose sight of,
or approve, the efforts which have been made in all ages, and which
are still making, to alter, by force or fraud, the natural equivalence
of services? This is exactly when we repudiate as a violation of
the natural social laws, as an attack upon property,—for, in our
view, the terms, free exchange of services, justice, property, liberty,
<a id="p222" class="xxpn">[p222]</a> security, all express the same idea under different aspects. It is
not the principle of Property which we contest, but the antagonistic
principle of Spoliation. Proprietors of all ranks! reformers
of all schools! this is the mission which should reconcile and
unite us.</p>

<p>It is time, high time, that this crusade should begin. A mere
theoretical war against Property is by no means the most virulent
or the most dangerous. Since the beginning of the world there
has existed a practical conspiracy against it which is not likely
soon to cease. War, slavery, imposture, oppressive imposts, monopolies,
privileges, commercial frauds, colonies, right to employment,
right to credit, right to assistance, right to instruction, progressive
taxation imposed in direct or inverse proportion to our
power of bearing it, are so many battering-rams directed against
the tottering edifice; and if the truth must come out, would you
tell me whether there are many men in France, even among those
who think themselves conservative, who do not, in one form or
another, lend a hand to this work of destruction?</p>

<p>There are people to whose optics property never appears in any
other form than that of a field or a bag of crown-pieces. If you
do not overstep sacred landmarks, or sensibly empty their pockets,
they feel quite comfortable. But is there no other kind of Property?
Is there not the Property of muscular force and intellectual
power, of faculties, of ideas—in a word, the Property of Services?
When I throw a service into the social scale, is it not my right
that it should be held there, if I may use the expression, suspended,
according to the laws of its natural equivalence; that it
may there form a counterpoise to any other service which my
neighbour may consent to throw into the opposite scale and tender
me in exchange? The law of common consent agreed to establish
a public force for the protection of property thus understood. But
in what situation are we placed if this very force assumes to itself
the mission of disturbing the equilibrium, under the socialist pretext
that liberty gives birth to monopoly, and that the doctrine of
<em class="e000I2">laissez faire</em> is odious and heartless? When things go on in this
way, individual theft may be rare, and may be severely punished,
but spoliation is organized, legalized, and erected into a system.
Comfort yourselves, Reformers! your work is not yet done—only
try to understand what that work really is.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>But before proceeding to analyze spoliation, whether public or
private, legal or illegal, and to consider its bearing as an element
in the social problem, and the part which it plays in the business
<a id="p223" class="xxpn">[p223]</a> of the world, it is necessary to form just ideas, if possible, of Community
and Property; for, as we shall by-and-by see, spoliation
forms a limit to property, just as property forms a limit to community.</p>

<p>From the preceding Chapters, especially that which treats of
Utility and Value, we may deduce this formula:</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Every man enjoys</em> <em class="e0U003">GRATUITOUSLY</em> <em class="e000I2">all the utilities furnished or
created by nature, on condition of taking the trouble to appropriate
them, or of returning an equivalent service to those who render him
the service of taking that trouble for him</em>.</p>

<p>Here we have two facts combined and mixed up together, although
in their own nature distinct.</p>

<p>We have the gifts of nature—gratuitous materials, gratuitous
forces. This is the domain of <em class="e000I2">Community</em>.</p>

<p>We have also human efforts devoted to the appropriation of
these materials, to the direction of these forces,—efforts which are
exchanged, <em class="e000I2">estimated</em>, and compensated. This is the domain of
<em class="e000I2">Property</em>.</p>

<p>In other words, as regards both, we are not owners of the Utility
of things, but of their Value, and value is simply the appreciation
of reciprocal services.</p>

<p>Property, Community, are two ideas correlative to the ideas of
<em class="e000I2">onerosity</em> and <em class="e000I2">gratuitousness</em>, on which they are founded.</p>

<p>That which is <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> is <em class="e000I2">common</em>, for every one enjoys a
portion of it, and enjoys it unconditionally.</p>

<p>That which is <em class="e000I2">onerous</em> is <em class="e000I2">appropriated</em>, because trouble taken,
effort made, is the condition of its enjoyment, as the enjoyment is
the reason for taking the trouble, or making the effort.</p>

<p>Does an exchange intervene? It is effected by a comparative
estimate of the two efforts or the two services.</p>

<p>This reference to trouble, to pains, implies the existence of an
Obstacle. We may then conclude that the object sought for
approximates more nearly to the gratuitous and the common, in
proportion as the obstacle is less; as, by hypothesis, the complete
absence of obstacle would render it perfectly gratuitous and
common.</p>

<p>Now, with reference to human nature, which is progressive and
perfectible, the obstacle can never be regarded as an absolute
and invariable quantity. It diminishes. Then the pains taken
diminish along with it—and the service with the pains—and value
with the service—and property with value.</p>

<p>And the Utility remains the same. Then the gratuitous and the
common have gained all that onerosity and property have lost. <a id="p224" class="xxpn">[p224]</a></p>

<p>To determine man to labour he must have a motive, and that
motive is the satisfaction he has in view, or utility. His undoubted
and irrepressible tendency is to realize the greatest
possible satisfaction with the least possible labour, to cause the
greatest amount of utility to correspond with the greatest amount
of property. Whence it follows that the mission of Property, or
rather of the spirit of property, is to realize, in a greater and
greater degree, Community.</p>

<p>The starting point of the human race being the maximum of
poverty, or the maximum of obstacles to be overcome, it is clear
that for all that is gained from one age to another we are indebted
to the spirit of property.</p>

<p>This being so, is there to be found in the world a single theoretical
adversary of the institution of property? Is it possible to
imagine a social force at once so just and so popular? The fundamental
dogma of Proudhon himself is the <em class="e000I2">mutuality of services</em>.
On this point we are agreed. What we differ upon is, that I give
this the name of <em class="e000I2">Property</em>, because, on going to the root of the
matter, I am convinced that men, if they are free, neither have,
nor can have, any other property than that of value, or of services.
On the contrary, Proudhon, like most Economists, thinks that
certain natural agents have <em class="e000I2">a value which is inherent in them</em>, and
that in consequence of that they are <em class="e000I2">appropriated</em>. But as regards
property in services, far from contesting it, he adopts it as his
creed. Do you wish to go still farther? to go the length of
asserting that a man should not have a right of property in his
own exertions? Will it be said that by exchange it is not enough
to transfer gratuitously the co-operation of natural agents, but also
to cede gratuitously one’s own efforts? This is indeed a dangerous
doctrine; it is to glorify slavery; for to assert that certain
men must render, is to assert that other men must receive, services
which are not remunerated, and that is slavery. But if you say
that this gratuitous interchange must be reciprocal, you get into
an incomprehensible logomachy; for either there is some equity
in exchange, and then the services will, in one way or another, be
<em class="e000I2">estimated</em> and compensated; or they will not be estimated and
compensated,—in which case the one party will render a great
amount of service, and the other a small amount, and you will fall
back again into slavery.</p>

<p>But it is impossible to contest the legitimate nature of Property
in services which are exchanged on the principle of equivalence.
To explain their legitimacy we have no need to have recourse to
philosophy, or jurisprudence, or metaphysics. Socialists, Economists,
<a id="p225" class="xxpn">[p225]</a> Advocates of Equality and Fraternity,—I defy the whole
body, numerous as it is, to raise even the shadow of an objection
against the <em class="e000I2">legitimate mutuality of voluntary services</em>, and consequently
against Property, such as I have defined it, such as it
actually exists in the natural social order.</p>

<p>I know very well that in practice the reign of Property is far
from being an undivided sway, and that we have always to deal
with an antagonistic fact. There are services which are not voluntary;
there is remuneration which is not freely stipulated; there
are services whose equivalence is impaired by force or by fraud;
in a word, there is Spoliation. The legitimate principle of Property,
however, is not thereby invalidated but confirmed. The
very fact of its being violated proves its existence. If we put
faith in anything in this world—in facts, in justice, in universal
assent, in human language—we must admit that these two words,
Property and Spoliation, express ideas which are as opposite, as
irreconcilable, as far from being identical as yes and no, light and
darkness, good and evil, harmony and discord. Taken literally,
the celebrated formula that <em class="e000I2">property is theft</em> is absurd in the very
highest degree. It would not be more monstrous to say that <em class="e000I2">theft
is property</em>, that what is legitimate is illegitimate, that what is is
not, etc. The author of this whimsical aphorism probably wished
to show how ingeniously he could support a paradox, and meant no
more than this, that certain men are paid not only for work which
they do but for work which they don’t do, thus appropriating to
themselves, exclusively, gratuitous utility—the gifts vouchsafed by
God for the good of all. In this case all that we have to do is to
prove the assertion, and substitute the truism that <em class="e000I2">theft is theft</em>.</p>

<p>To <em class="e000I2">steal</em> means, in ordinary language, to appropriate, by force or
fraud, a value, to the prejudice and without the consent of the
person who has created that value. It is easy to see how a false
Political Economy has succeeded in enlarging the sense of that
ugly word <em class="e000I2">steal</em>. You begin by confounding utility with value.
Then, as nature co-operates in the creation of utility, you conclude
that nature also concurs in the creation of Value, and you say that
this portion of value, being the fruit of no one’s labour, belongs to
all. At length, finding that value is never transferred without remuneration,
you add, that the man who exacts a recompense for a
value which is the creation of nature, which is independent of all
human labour, which is <em class="e000I2">inherent in things</em>, and is by the destination
of Providence one of their <em class="e000I2">intrinsic qualities</em>, like weight or
porosity, form or colour, <em class="e000I2">commits a robbery</em>.</p>

<p>An exact analysis of value overturns this scaffolding of <a id="p226" class="xxpn">[p226]</a> subtilties
intended to prop up a monstrous assimilation of Property with
Spoliation.</p>

<p>God has placed certain Materials and certain Forces at the disposal
of man. In order to obtain possession of these materials and
forces, Labour is necessary, or it is not. If it be not necessary, no
one will voluntarily consent to purchase from another, by means
of an effort, what, without any effort, he can obtain from the hands
of Nature. In this case, services, exchange, value, <em class="e000I2">Property</em>, are
out of the question. If, on the other hand, labour be necessary,
in equity it falls upon the person who is to receive the satisfaction;
whence it follows that the satisfaction is the recompense of the
pains taken, the effort made, the labour undergone. Here you
have the principle of Property. This being so, a man takes pains,
or submits to labour, for his own benefit, and becomes possessed
of the whole utility realized by this labour co-operating with
nature. He takes pains, or submits to labour, for another, and in
that case he bargains to receive in return an equivalent service,
which is likewise the vehicle of utility, and the result exhibits two
Efforts, two Utilities which have changed hands, and two Satisfactions.
But we must not lose sight of this, that the transaction is
effected by the comparison, by the <em class="e000I2">appreciation</em>, not of the two
utilities (they cannot be brought to this test), but of the two services
exchanged. It is then exact to say that, in a personal point of view,
man, by means of labour, becomes proprietor of natural utility
(that is the object of his labour), whatever be the relation (which
may vary <em class="e000I2">ad infinitum</em>) of labour to utility. But in a <em class="e000I2">social</em> point
of view, or in reference to each other, men are never proprietors
except of value, the foundation of which is not the liberality of
nature, but human service, pains taken, danger encountered, skill
displayed, in securing that liberality. In a word, in what concerns
natural and gratuitous utility, the last acquirer, the person
who is the recipient of the satisfaction, is placed, by exchange, in
the shoes of the first labourer. The latter has found himself in
presence of a gratuitous utility which he has taken the pains to
appropriate; the former returns him an equivalent service, and
thus substitutes himself in the other’s right and place; utility is
acquired by him by the same title, that is to say, by a gratuitous
title, on condition of pains taken. There is here, neither in fact
nor in appearance, any improper interception of the gifts of God.</p>

<p>I venture, then, to lay down this proposition as unassailable:</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">In relation to one another, men are proprietors only of values, and
values represent only services compared, and voluntarily received and
rendered.</em> <a id="p227" class="xxpn">[p227]</a></p>

<p>That, on the one hand, the true meaning of the word <em class="e000I2">value</em> is
what I have already demonstrated it to be (Chapter V.); and that,
on the other, men are never, and never can be, as regards each
other, proprietors of anything but <em class="e000I2">value</em>, is evident as well from reasoning
as from experience. From reasoning—for why should I go
to purchase from a man, by means of an effort, what, without any
effort, I can obtain from nature? From universal experience, which
is too weighty to be despised in this question,—nothing being more
fitted to give us confidence in a theory than the rational and practical
acquiescence of men of all ages and all countries. Now I say
that universal consent ratifies the sense which I give here to the
word Property. When a public officer makes an inventory after a
death, or by authority of justice, of when a merchant, manufacturer,
or farmer does the same thing for his own satisfaction, or
when it is done by officials under a bankruptcy—what do they
inscribe on the stamped rolls as each object presents itself? Is it
its <em class="e000I2">utility</em>, its intrinsic merit? No, it is its <em class="e000I2">value</em>, that is to say,
the equivalent of the trouble which, any purchaser taken at random
would have in procuring himself a similar commodity. Does
a jury named by a judge to report upon a work or a commodity
inquire whether it be more useful than another work or commodity?
Do they take into consideration the enjoyments which may
be thereby procured? Do they esteem a hammer more than a
china jar, because the hammer is admirably adapted to make the
law of gravitation available to its possessor? or a glass of water
more than a diamond, because the former is capable of rendering
more substantial service? or the work of Say more than the work
of Fourier, because from the former we can draw more rational
enjoyment and more solid instruction? No, they <em class="e000I2">value</em>, they set
down the <em class="e000I2">value</em>, in rigorous conformity, observe, with my definition,
or, to say better, it is my definition which is in conformity
with their practice. They take into account, not the natural advantages,
or the gratuitous utility, attached to each commodity,
but the exertion which each acquirer should have to make for
himself, or to require another to make for him, in order to procure
it. They never think of the exertion which nature has made, if
I may hazard the expression, but upon the exertion which the purchaser
would have had to make. And when the operation is
terminated, when the public is told the sum total of Value which
is carried to the balance-sheet, they exclaim with one voice, Here
is the wealth which is available to the <em class="e00S02">Proprietor</em>.</p>

<p>As property includes nothing but value, and as value expresses
only a relation, it follows that property itself is only a relation. <a id="p228" class="xxpn">[p228]</a></p>

<p>When the public, on the inspection of two inventories, pronounces
one man to be richer than another, it is not meant to say
that the relative amount of the two properties is indicative of the
relative absolute wealth of the two men, or the amount of enjoyments
they can command. There enters into positive satisfactions
and enjoyments a certain amount of <em class="e000I2">common and gratuitous utility</em>
which alters this proportion very much. As regards the light of
day, the air we breathe, the heat of the sun, all men are equal;
and Inequality—as indicative of a difference in property or value
—has reference only to <em class="e000I2">onerous utility</em>.</p>

<p>Now I have often said, and I shall probably have occasion
frequently to repeat the remark (for it is the finest and most
striking, although perhaps the least understood, of the social
harmonies, and includes all the others), that it is of the essence
of progress—and indeed in this alone progress consists—to transform
onerous into gratuitous utility—to diminish value without
diminishing utility—to permit each individual to procure the
same things with less effort, either to make or to remunerate; to
increase continually the mass of things which are <em class="e000I2">common</em>, and the
enjoyment of which, being distributed in a uniform manner among
all, effaces by degrees the Inequality which results from difference
of fortune.</p>

<p>We must not omit to analyze very carefully the result of this
mechanism.</p>

<p>In contemplating the phenomena of the social world, how often
have I had occasion to feel the profound justice of Rousseau’s
saying: “Il faut beaucoup de philosophie pour observer ce qu’on
voit tous les jours!” It is difficult to observe accurately what we
see every day; <em class="e000I2">Custom</em>, that veil which blinds the eyes of the
vulgar, and which the attentive observer cannot always throw off,
prevents our discerning the most marvellous of all the Economic
phenomena: real wealth falling incessantly from the domain of
Property into that of Community.</p>

<p>Let us endeavour to demonstrate and explain this democratic
evolution, and, if possible, test its range and its effects.</p>

<p>I have remarked elsewhere that if we desire to compare two
epochs as regards real wealth and prosperity, we must refer all to
a common standard, which is unskilled labour measured by time,
and ask ourselves this question—What difference in the amount of
satisfaction, according to the degree of advancement which society
has reached, is a determinate quantity of unskilled labour—for
example, a day’s work of a common labourer—capable of yielding
us? <a id="p229" class="xxpn">[p229]</a></p>

<p>This question implies two others:</p>

<p>What was the relation of the satisfaction to unskilled labour at
the beginning of the period? What is it now?</p>

<p>The difference will be the measure of the advance which gratuitous
utility has made relatively to onerous utility—the domain
of community relatively to that of property.</p>

<p>I believe that for the politician no problem can be proposed
more interesting and instructive than this; and the reader must
pardon me if, in order to arrive at a satisfactory solution of it, I
fatigue him with too many examples.</p>

<p>I made, at the outset, a sort of catalogue of the most common
human wants: respiration, food, clothing, lodging, locomotion,
instruction, amusement, etc.</p>

<p>Let us resume the same order, and inquire what amount of
satisfactions a common day-labourer could at the beginning, and
can now, procure himself, by a determinate number of days’ labour.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Respiration.</em>—Here all is completely gratuitous and common
from the beginning. Nature does all, and leaves us nothing to do.
Efforts, services, value, property, progress, are all out of the question.
As regards utility, Diogenes is as rich as Alexander—as
regards value, Alexander is as rich as Diogenes.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Food.</em>—At present, the value of a hectolitre of corn in France
is the equivalent of from 15 to 20 days’ work of a common unskilled
labourer. This is a fact which we may regard as unimportant,
but it is not the less worthy of remark. It is a fact that
in our day, viewing humanity in its least advanced aspect, and as
represented by a penniless workman, enjoyment measured by a
hectolitre of corn can be obtained by an expenditure of 15 days’
unskilled labour. The ordinary calculation is, that three hectolitres
of corn annually are required for the subsistence of one
man. The common labourer, then, produces, if not his subsistence,
what comes to the same thing, the value of his subsistence, by an
expenditure of from 45 to 60 days’ labour in the year. If we
represent the type of value by <em class="e000I2">one</em> (in this case <em class="e000I2">one day’s unskilled
labour</em>), the value of a hectolitre of corn will be expressed by 15,
18, or 20, according to the year. The relation of these two values
is, say, <em class="e000I2">one to fifteen</em>.</p>

<p>To discover if progress has been made, and to measure it, we
must inquire what this relation was in the early days of the
human race. In truth, I dare not hazard a figure, but there is
one way of clearing up the difficulty. When you hear a man
declaiming against the social order, against the appropriation of
the soil, against rent, against machinery, lead him into the middle
<a id="p230" class="xxpn">[p230]</a> of a primitive forest and in sight of a pestilential morass. Say to
him, I wish to free you from the yoke of which you complain,—I
wish to withdraw you from the atrocious struggles of anarchical
competition, from the antagonism of interests, from the selfishness
of wealth, from the oppression of property, from the crushing
rivalry of machinery, from the stifling atmosphere of society.
Here is land exactly like what the first clearers had to encounter.
Take as much of it as you please—take it by tens, by hundreds of
acres. Cultivate it yourself. All that you can make it produce is
yours. I make but one condition, that you will not have recourse
to that society of which you represent yourself as the victim.</p>

<p>As regards the soil, observe, this man would be placed in
exactly the same situation which mankind at large occupied at the
beginning. Now I fear not to be contradicted when I assert that
this man would not produce a hectolitre of corn in two years:
Ratio 15 to 600.</p>

<p>And now we can measure the progress which has been made.
As regards corn—and despite his being obliged to pay rent for his
land, interest for his capital, and hire for his tools—or rather
because he pays them—a labourer now obtains with 15 days’
work what he would formerly have had difficulty in procuring with
600 days’ work. The value of corn, then, measured by unskilled
labour, has fallen from 600 to 15, or from 40 to 1. A hectolitre
of corn has for man the same utility it had the day after the
deluge—it contains the same quantity of alimentary substance—it
satisfies the same want, and in the same degree. It constitutes
an equal amount of <em class="e000I2">real wealth</em>—it does not constitute an equal
amount of <em class="e000I2">relative wealth</em>. Its production has been transferred in
a great measure <em class="e000I2">to the charge of nature</em>. It is obtained with <em class="e000I2">less</em>
human <em class="e000I2">effort</em>. It renders <em class="e000I2">less service</em> in passing from hand to hand,
it has less <em class="e000I2">value</em>. In a word, it has become <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>—not
absolutely, but in the proportion of 40 to 1.</p>

<p>And not only has it become <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>—it has become <em class="e000I2">common</em>
to the same extent. For it is not to the profit of the person who
produces the corn that 39-40ths of the effort have been annihilated,
but to the advantage of the consumer, whatever be the kind of
labour to which he devotes himself.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Clothing.</em>—We have here again the same phenomenon. A common
day-labourer enters one of the warehouses at the Marais,<a
href="#FN_54" id="FNa_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> and
there obtains clothing corresponding to twenty days of his labour,
which we suppose to be unskilled. Were he to attempt to make
<a id="p231" class="xxpn">[p231]</a> this clothing himself, his whole life would be insufficient. Had
he desired to obtain the same clothing in the time of Henri
Quatre, it would have cost him three or four hundred days’ work.
What then has become of this difference in the <em class="e000I2">value</em> of these
stuffs in relation to the quantity of unskilled labour? It has been
annihilated, because the <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> forces of nature now perform
a great portion of the work, and it has been annihilated to the
advantage of mankind at large.</p>

<p>For we must not fail to remark here, that every man owes his
neighbour a service equivalent to what he has received from him.
If, then, the art of the weaver had made no progress, if weaving
were not executed in part by <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> forces, the weaver would
still be occupied two or three hundred days in fabricating these
stuffs, and our workman would require to give him two or three
hundred days’ work in order to obtain the clothing he wants.
And since the weaver cannot succeed, with all his wish to do so
in obtaining two or three hundred days’ labour in recompense for
the intervention of gratuitous forces, and for the progress achieved,
we are warranted in saving that this progress has been effected to
the advantage of the purchaser or consumer, and that it is a gain
to society at large.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Conveyance.</em>—Prior to all progress, when the human race, like
our day-labourer, was obliged to make use of primitive and unskilled
labour, if a man had desired to have a load of a hundredweight
transported from Paris to Bayonne, he would have had
only this alternative, either to take the load on his own shoulders,
and perform the work himself, travelling over hill and dale, which
would have required a year’s labour, or else to ask some one to
perform this rough piece of work for him; and as, by hypothesis,
the person who undertook this work would have to employ the
same means and the same time, he would undoubtedly demand a
remuneration equal to a year’s labour. At that period, then, the
value of unskilled labour being <em class="e000I2">one</em>, that of transport was 300 for
the weight of a cwt. and a distance of 200 leagues.</p>

<p>But things are changed now. In fact there is no workman in
Paris who cannot obtain the same result by the sacrifice of two
days’ labour. The alternative indeed is still the same. He must
either do the work himself, or get others to do it for him by remunerating
them. If our day-labourer perform it himself, it will still
cost him a year of fatigue; but if he applies to men who make it
their business, he will find twenty carriers to do what he wants
for three or four francs, that is to say, for the equivalent of two
days’ unskilled labour. Thus the value of such labour being
<a id="p232" class="xxpn">[p232]</a> represented by <em class="e000I2">one</em>, that of transport, which was represented by
300, is now reduced to <em class="e000I2">two</em>.</p>

<p>In what way has this astonishing revolution been brought
about? Ages have been required to accomplish it. Animals
have been trained, mountains have been pierced, valleys have been
filled up, bridges have been thrown across rivers, sledges and
afterwards wheeled carriages have been invented, obstacles, which
give rise to labour, services, value, have been removed; in short,
we have succeeded in accomplishing, with labour equal to two,
what our remote ancestors would have effected only by labour
equal to 300. This progress has been realized by men who had no
thought but for their own interests. And yet, who profits by it
now? Our poor day-labourer, and with him society at large.</p>

<p>Let no one say that this is not Community. I say that it is
Community in the strictest sense of the word. At the outset the
satisfaction in question was, in the estimation of all, the equivalent
of 300 days’ unskilled labour, or a proportionally smaller amount
of skilled labour. Now 298 parts of this labour out of 300 are
performed by nature, and mankind are exonerated to a corresponding
extent. Now, evidently all men are in exactly the same
situation as regards the obstacles which have been removed, the
distance which has been wiped out, the fatigue which has been
obviated, the value which has been annihilated, since all obtain
the result without having to pay for it. What they pay for is the
human effort which remains still to be made, as compared with
and measured by two days’ work of an unskilled labourer. In
other words, the man who has not himself effected this improvement,
and who has only muscular force to offer in exchange, has
still to give two days’ labour to secure the satisfaction he wishes
to obtain. All other men can obtain it with a smaller sacrifice of
labour. The Paris lawyer, earning 30,000 francs a year, can
obtain it for a twenty-fifth part of a day’s labour, etc.,—by which
we see that all men are equal as regards the value annihilated,
and that the inequality is restrained within the limits of the
portion of value which survives the change, that is, within the
domain of Property.</p>

<p>Economical science labours under a disadvantage in being
obliged to have recourse to hypothetical cases. The reader is
taught to believe that the phenomena which we wish to describe
are to be discovered only in special cases, adduced for the sake of
illustration. But it is evident that what we have said of corn,
clothing, and means of transport, is true of everything else. When
an author generalizes, it is for the reader to particularize; and
<a id="p233" class="xxpn">[p233]</a> when the former devotes himself to cold and forbidding analysis,
the latter may at least indulge in the pleasures of synthesis.</p>

<p>The synthetic law may be reduced to this formula:</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Value, which is social property, springs from Effort and Obstacle.</em></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">In proportion as the obstacle is lessened, effort, value, or the domain
of property, is diminished along with it.</em></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">With reference to each given satisfaction, Property always recedes
and Community always advances.</em></p>

<p>Must we then conclude with M. Proudhon that the days of
Property are numbered? Because, as regards each useful result
to be realized, each satisfaction to be obtained, Property recedes
before Community, are we thence to conclude that the former
is about to be absorbed and annihilated altogether?</p>

<p>To adopt this conclusion would be to mistake completely the
nature of man. We encounter here a sophism analogous to the
one we have already refuted on the subject of the interest of
capital. Interest has a tendency to fall, it is said; then it is
destined ultimately to disappear altogether. Value and property
go on diminishing; then they are destined, it is now said, to be
annihilated.</p>

<p>The whole sophism consists in omitting the words, <em class="e000I2">for each determinate
result</em>. It is quite true that men obtain <em class="e000I2">determinate results</em>
with a less amount of effort—it is in this respect that they
are progressive and perfectible—it is on this account that we are
able to affirm that the <em class="e000I2">relative</em> domain of property becomes narrower,
looking at it as regards each given satisfaction.</p>

<p>But it is not true that all the <em class="e000I2">results</em> which it is <em class="e000I2">possible</em> to obtain
are ever exhausted, and hence it is absurd to suppose that it is in
the nature of progress to lessen or limit the <em class="e000I2">absolute</em> domain of
property.</p>

<p>We have repeated often, and in every shape, that each given
effort may, in course of time, serve as the vehicle of a greater
amount of gratuitous utility, without our being warranted thence
to conclude that men should ever cease to make efforts. All that
we can conclude from it is, that their forces, thus rendered disposable,
will be employed in combating other obstacles, and will
realize, with equal labour, satisfactions hitherto unknown.</p>

<p>I must enlarge still farther on this idea. These are not times
to leave anything to possible misconstruction when we venture to
pronounce the fearful words, Property and Community.</p>

<p>Man in a state of isolation can, at any given moment of his
existence, exert only a certain amount of effort; and the same thing
holds of society. <a id="p234" class="xxpn">[p234]</a></p>

<p>When man in a state of isolation realizes a step of progress, by
making natural agents co-operate with his own labour, the sum of
his efforts is reduced by so much, <em class="e000I2">in relation to the useful result
sought for</em>. It would be reduced not relatively only, but <em class="e000I2">absolutely</em>,
if this man, content with his original condition, should convert his
progress into leisure, and should abstain from devoting to the acquisition
of new enjoyments that portion of effort which is now
rendered disposable. That would take for granted that ambition,
desire, aspiration, were limited forces, and that the human heart
was not indefinitely expansible; but it is quite otherwise. Robinson
Crusoe has no sooner handed over part of his work to natural
agents, than he devotes his efforts to new enterprises. The sum
total of his efforts remains the same,—but one portion of these
efforts, aided by a greater amount of natural and gratuitous co-operation,
has become more productive, more prolific. This is
exactly the phenomenon which we see realized in society.</p>

<p>Because the plough, the harrow, the hammer, the saw, oxen, and
horses, the sail, water-power, steam, have successively relieved
mankind from an enormous amount of labour, in proportion to
each result obtained, it does not necessarily follow that this labour,
thus set free and rendered disposable, should lie dormant. Remember
what has been already said as to the indefinite expansibility
of our wants and desires—and note what is passing around
you—and you will not fail to see that as often as man succeeds in
vanquishing an obstacle by the aid of natural agents, he sets his
own forces to grapple with other obstacles. We have more
facility in the art of printing than we had formerly, but we print
more. Each book corresponds to a less amount of human effort,
to less value, less property; but we have more books, and, on
the whole, the same amount of effort, value, property. The same
thing might be said of clothing, of houses, of railways, of all human
productions. It is not the aggregate of values which has diminished;
it is the aggregate of utilities which has increased. It is
not the <em class="e000I2">absolute</em> domain of Property which has been narrowed;
it is the absolute domain of Community which has been enlarged.
Progress has not paralyzed labour; it has augmented wealth.</p>

<p>Things that are gratuitous and common to all are within the
domain of natural forces; and it is as true in theory as in fact that
this domain is constantly extending.</p>

<p>Value and Property are within the domain of human efforts, of
reciprocal services, and this domain becomes narrower and narrower
as regards each given result, but not as regards the aggregate
of results; as regards each determinate satisfaction, but not
<a id="p235" class="xxpn">[p235]</a> as regards the aggregate of satisfactions, because the amount of
<em class="e000I2">possible</em> enjoyments is without limit.</p>

<p>It is as true, then, that relative Property gives place to Community,
as it is false that absolute Property tends to disappear
altogether. Property is a pioneer which accomplishes its work in
one circle, and then passes into another. Before property could
disappear altogether we must suppose every obstacle to have been
removed, labour to have been superseded, human efforts to have
become useless; we must suppose men to have no longer need to
effect exchanges, or render services to each other; we must suppose
all production to be spontaneous, and enjoyment to spring
directly from desire; in a word, we must suppose men to have
become equal to gods. Then, indeed, all would be gratuitous,
and we should have all things in common. Effort, service, value,
property, everything indicative of our native weakness and infirmity,
would cease to exist.</p>

<p>In vain man raises himself in the social scale, and advances on
the road of civilisation—he is as far as ever from Omnipotence.
It is one of the attributes of the Divinity, as far as we can understand
what is so much above human reason, that between volition
and result no obstacle is interposed. God said, <em class="e000I2">Let there be light,
and there was light</em>. And it is the powerlessness of man to express
that to which there is so little analogous in his own nature, which
reduced Moses to the necessity of supposing between the divine
will and the creation of light the intervention of an obstacle in
the shape even of a word to be pronounced. But whatever
advance man, in virtue of his progressive nature, may be destined
yet to make, we may safely affirm that he will never succeed in
freeing himself entirely from the obstacles which encumber his
path, or in rendering himself independent of the labour of his
head and of his hands. The reason is obvious. In proportion as
certain obstacles are overcome, his desires dilate and expand, and
new obstacles oppose themselves to new efforts. We shall always,
then, have labour to perform, to exchange, to estimate, and to
value. Property will exist until the consummation of all things,
increasing in mass in proportion as men become more active and
more numerous; whilst at the same time each effort, each service,
each value, each portion of property, considered relatively, will, in
passing from hand to hand, serve as the vehicle of an increasing
proportion of common and gratuitous utility.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>The reader will observe that we use the word Property in a
very extended sense, but a sense which on that account is not the
<a id="p236" class="xxpn">[p236]</a> less exact. <em class="e000I2">Property is the right which a man possesses of applying
to his own use his own efforts, or of not giving them away except in
consideration of equivalent efforts.</em> The distinction between Proprietors
and Prolétaires, then, is radically false, unless it is pretended
that there is a class of men who do no work, who have no
control over their own exertions, or over the services which they
render and those which they receive in exchange.</p>

<p>It is wrong to restrict the term Property to one of its special
forms, to capital, to land, to what yields interest or rent; and it is
in consequence of this erroneous definition that we proceed afterwards
to separate men into two antagonist classes. Analysis
demonstrates that interest and rent are the fruit of services rendered,
and have the same origin, the same nature, the same rights
as manual labour.</p>

<p>The world may be regarded as a vast workshop which Providence
has supplied abundantly with materials and forces of which
human labour makes use. Anterior efforts, present efforts, even
future efforts, or promises of efforts, are exchanged for each other.
Their relative merit, as established by exchange, and independently
of gratuitous forces and materials, brings out the element
of value; and it is of the value created by each individual that
each is owner or proprietor.</p>

<p>But what does it signify, it may be said, that a man is proprietor
only of the value, or of the acknowledged merit of his service?
The possession of the value carries along with it that of the
utility which is mingled with it. John has two sacks of corn.
Peter has only one. John, you say, is twice as rich in <em class="e000I2">value</em>.
Surely, then, he is also twice as rich in utility, even natural utility.
He has twice as much to eat.</p>

<p>Unquestionably it is so: but has he not performed double the
labour?</p>

<p>Let us come, nevertheless, to the root of the objection.</p>

<p>Essential, absolute wealth resides, as we have said, in utility.
The very word implies this. It is <em class="e000I2">utility</em> alone which renders
<em class="e000I2">service</em> (<em class="e000I2">uti</em>—in French <em class="e000I2">servir</em>). It alone has relation to our
wants, and it is it alone which man has in view when he
devotes himself to labour. Utility at all events is the ultimate
object of pursuit; for things do not satisfy our hunger or quench
our thirst because they include value, but because they possess
utility.</p>

<p>We muse take into account, however, the phenomenon which
society exhibits in this respect.</p>

<p>Man in a state of isolation seeks to realize utility without
<a id="p237" class="xxpn">[p237]</a> thinking about value, of which, in that state, he can have no
idea.</p>

<p>In the social state, on the contrary, man seeks to realize value
irrespective of utility. The commodity he produces is not intended
to satisfy his own wants, and he has little interest in its being
useful or not. It is for the person who desires to acquire it to
judge of that. What concerns the producer is, that it should bear
as high a value as possible in the market, as he is certain that the
utilities he has to receive in return will be in proportion to the
value of what he carries thither.</p>

<p>The division of labour and of occupation leads to this result,
that each produces what he does not himself consume, and consumes
what he does not himself produce. As producers, what we
are in quest of is value; as consumers, what we seek is utility.
Universal experience testifies to this. The man who polishes a
diamond, or embroiders lace, or distils brandy, or cultivates the
poppy, never inquires whether the consumption of these commodities
is good or bad in itself. He gives his work, and if his
work realizes value, that is enough for him.</p>

<p>And let me here remark in passing, that the moral or immoral
has nothing to do with labour, but with desire; and that society is
improved, not by rendering the producer, but the consumer, more
moral. What an outcry was raised against the English on account
of their cultivating opium in India for the deliberate purpose,
it was said, of poisoning the Chinese! This was to misunderstand
and misapply the principle of morality. No one will ever
be effectually prevented from producing a commodity which, being
in demand, is possessed of value. It is for the man who demands
a particular species of enjoyment to calculate the effects of it; and
it is in vain that we attempt to divorce foresight from responsibility.
Our vine-growers produce wine, and will produce it as
long as it possesses value, without troubling themselves to inquire
whether this wine leads to drunkenness in Europe or to suicide in
America. It is the judgment which men form as to their wants
and satisfactions that determines the direction of labour. This is
true even of man in an isolated state; and if a foolish vanity had
spoken more loudly to Robinson Crusoe than hunger, he would,
in place of devoting his time to the chase, have employed it in
arranging feathers for his hat. It is the same with nations as
with individuals—serious people have serious pursuits, and frivolous
people devote themselves to frivolous occupations.</p>

<p>But to return:</p>

<p>The man who works for himself has in view utility. <a id="p238" class="xxpn">[p238]</a></p>

<p>The man who works for others has in view value.</p>

<p>Now Property, as I have defined it, is founded on Value, and
value being simply a relation, it follows that property is also a
relation.</p>

<p>Were there only one man upon the earth, the idea of Property
would never enter his mind. Monarch of all he surveyed, surrounded
with utilities which he had only to adapt to his use, never
encountering any analogous right to serve as a limit to his own,
how should it ever come into his head to say <em class="e000I2">This is mine</em>? That
would imply the correlative assertion, <em class="e000I2">This is not mine</em>, or <em class="e000I2">This
belongs to another</em>. <em class="e000I2">Meum</em> and <em class="e000I2">tuum</em> are inconsistent with isolation,
and the word Property necessarily implies relation; but it gives
us emphatically to understand that a thing is <em class="e000I2">proper</em> to one person,
only by giving us to understand that it is not <em class="e000I2">proper</em> to anybody
else.</p>

<p>“The first man,” says Rousseau, “who having enclosed a field,
took it into his head to say <em class="e000I2">This is mine</em>, was the true founder of
civil society.”</p>

<p>What does the enclosure mean if it be not indicative of exclusion,
and consequently of relation? If its object were only to
defend the field against the intrusion of animals, it was a precaution,
not a sign of property. A boundary, on the contrary, is
a mark of property, not of precaution.</p>

<p>Thus men are truly proprietors only in relation to one another;
and this being so, of what are they proprietors? Of value, as we
discover very clearly in the exchanges they make with each
other.</p>

<p>Let us, according to our usual practice, take a very simple case
by way of illustration.</p>

<p>Nature labours, and has done so probably from all eternity, to
invest spring water with those qualities which fit it for quenching
our thirst, and which qualities, so far as we are concerned, constitute
its <em class="e000I2">utility</em>. It is assuredly not my work, for it has been
elaborated without my assistance, and quite unknown to me. In
this respect I can truly say that water is to me the gratuitous gift
of God. What is my own <em class="e000I2">proper</em> work is the effort which I have
made in going to fetch my supply of water for the day.</p>

<p>Of what do I become proprietor by that act?</p>

<p>As regards myself, I am proprietor, if I may use the expression,
of all the utility with which nature has invested this water. I
can turn it to my own use in any way I think proper. It is for
that purpose that I have taken the trouble to fetch it. To dispute
my right would be to say that, although men cannot live without
<a id="p239" class="xxpn">[p239]</a> drinking, they have no right to drink the water which they
have procured by their own exertions. I do not believe that
the Communists, although they go very far, will go the length
of asserting this, and even under the <em class="e000I2">régime</em> of Cabet, the lambs
of Icaria would be allowed to quench their thirst in the limpid
stream.</p>

<p>But in relation to other men, who are free to do as I do, I am
not, and cannot be, proprietor except of what is called, by metonymy,
<em class="e000I2">the value of the water</em>, that is to say, the value of the
<em class="e000I2">service</em> which I render in procuring it.</p>

<p>My right to drink this water being granted, it is impossible to
contest my right to give it away. And the right of the other
contracting party to go to the spring, as I did, and draw water for
himself, being admitted, it is equally impossible to contest his right
to accept the water which I have fetched. If the one has a right
to give, and the other, in consideration of a payment voluntarily
bargained for, to accept, this water, the first is then the <em class="e000I2">proprietor</em>
in relation to the second. It is sad to write upon Political Economy
at a time when we cannot advance a step without having recourse
to demonstrations so puerile.</p>

<p>But on what basis is the arrangement we have supposed come to?
It is essential to know this, in order to appreciate the whole social
bearing of the word Property,—a word which sounds so ill in the
ears of democratic sentimentalism.</p>

<p>It is clear that, both parties being free, we must take into consideration
the trouble I have had, and the trouble I have saved to
the other party, as the circumstances which constitute value. We
discuss the conditions of the bargain, and, if we come to terms,
there is neither exaggeration nor subtilty in saying that my
neighbour has acquired <em class="e000I2">gratuitously</em>, or, if you will, as <em class="e000I2">gratuitously
as I did</em>, all the natural utility of the water. Do you desire proof
that the conditions, more or less onerous, of the transaction are
determined by the human efforts and not by the intrinsic utility?
It will be granted that the utility remains the same whether the
spring is distant or near at hand. It is the amount of exertion
made, or to be made, which depends upon the distance; and since
the remuneration varies with the exertion, it is in the latter, and
not in the utility, that the principle of relative value and Property
resides.</p>

<p>It is certain, then, that, in relation to others, I am, and can be,
proprietor only of my efforts, of my services, which have nothing
in common with the recondite and mysterious processes by which
nature communicates utility to the things which are the subject
<a id="p240" class="xxpn">[p240]</a> of those services. It would be in vain for me to carry my pretensions
farther—at this point we must always in fact encounter
the limit of Property;—for if I exact more than the value of my
services, my neighbour will do the work for himself. This limit
is absolute and unchangeable. It fully explains and vindicates
Property, thus reduced to the natural and simple right of demanding
one service for another. It shows that the enjoyment of
natural utility is appropriated only nominally and in appearance;
that the expression, Property in an acre of land, in a hundredweight
of iron, in a quarter of wheat, in a yard of cloth, is truly a
metonymy, like the expression, Value of water, of iron, and so
forth; and that so far as nature has given these things to men,
they enjoy them gratuitously and in common; in a word, that
Community is in perfect harmony with Property, the gifts of God
remaining in the domain of the one, and human services forming
alone the very legitimate domain of the other.</p>

<p>But from my having chosen a very simple example in order to
point out the line of demarcation which separates the domain of
what is common from the domain of what has been appropriated,
you are not to conclude that this line loses itself and disappears,
even in the most complicated transactions. It continues always
to show itself in every free transaction. The labour of going to
fetch water from the spring is very simple, no doubt; but when
you examine the thing more narrowly, you will be convinced that
the labour of raising corn is only more complicated because it
embraces a series of efforts quite as simple, in each of which the
work of nature co-operates with that of man, so that in fact the
example I have shown may be regarded as the type of every
economical fact. Take the case of water, of corn, of cloth, of
books, of transport, of pictures, of the ballet, of the opera,—in all,
certain circumstances, I allow, may impart such value to certain
services, but no one is ever paid for anything else than services,—never
certainly for the co-operation of nature,—and the reason is
obvious, because one of the contracting parties has it always in
his power to say, If you demand from me more than your service is
<em class="e000I2">worth</em>, I shall apply to another quarter, or do the work for myself.</p>

<p>But I am not content to vindicate Property; I should wish to
make it an object of cherished affection even to the most determined
Communists. And to accomplish this, all that is necessary
is to describe the popular, progressive, and equalizing part which
it plays; and to demonstrate clearly, not only that it does not
monopolize and concentrate in a few hands the gifts of God, but
that its special mission is to enlarge continually the sphere of
<a id="p241" class="xxpn">[p241]</a> Community. In this respect the natural laws of society are
much more ingenious than the artificial systems of Plato, Sir
Thomas More, Fénélon, or Monsieur Cabet.</p>

<p>That there are satisfactions which men enjoy, gratuitously and
in common, upon a footing of the most perfect equality,—that
there is in the social order, underlying Property, a real Community,—no
one will dispute. To see this it is not necessary that
you should be either an Economist or a Socialist, but that you
should have eyes in your head. In certain respects all the children
of God are treated in precisely the same way. All are equal
as regards the law of gravitation, which attaches them to the
earth, as regards the air we breathe, the light of day, the water of
the brook. This vast and measureless common fund, which has
nothing whatever to do with Value or Property, J. B. Say denominates
<em class="e000I2">natural wealth</em>, in opposition to <em class="e000I2">social wealth</em>; Proudhon,
<em class="e000I2">natural property</em>, in opposition to <em class="e000I2">acquired property</em>; Considérant,
<em class="e000I2">natural capital</em>, in opposition to <em class="e000I2">capital which is created</em>;
Saint-Chamans, the <em class="e000I2">wealth of enjoyment</em>, in opposition to the <em class="e000I2">wealth
of value</em>. We have denominated it <em class="e000I2">gratuitous utility</em>, in contradistinction
to <em class="e000I2">onerous utility</em>. Call it what you will, it exists, and
that entitles us to say that there is among men a common fund of
gratuitous and equal satisfactions.</p>

<p>And if wealth, <em class="e000I2">social</em>, <em class="e000I2">acquired</em>, <em class="e000I2">created</em>, <em class="e000I2">of value</em>, <em class="e000I2">onerous</em>, in a
word, Property, is unequally distributed, we cannot affirm that
it is unjustly so, seeing that it is in each man’s case proportional
to the <em class="e000I2">services</em> which give rise to it, and of which it is simply the
measure and estimate. Besides, it is clear that this Inequality is
lessened by the existence of the common fund, in virtue of the
mathematical rule: the relative inequality of two unequal numbers
is lessened by adding equal numbers to each of them. When our
inventories, then, show that one man is twice as rich as another
man, that proportion ceases to be exact when we take into consideration
their equal share in the gratuitous utility furnished by
nature, and the inequality would be gradually effaced and wiped
away if this common fund were itself progressive.</p>

<p>The problem, then, is to find out whether this <em class="e000I2">common fund</em> is a
fixed invariable quantity, given to mankind by Providence in the
beginning, and once for all, above which the <em class="e000I2">appropriated fund</em> is
superimposed, apart from the existence of any relation or action
between these two orders of phenomena.</p>

<p>Economists have concluded that the social order had no influence
upon this natural and common fund of wealth; and this is their
reason for excluding it from the domain of Political Economy. <a id="p242" class="xxpn">[p242]</a></p>

<p>The Socialists go farther. They believe that the constitution
of society tends to make this common fund pass into the region
of Property, that it consecrates, to the profit of a few, the usurpation
of what belongs to all; and this is the reason why they rise
up against Political Economy, which denies this fatal tendency,
and against modern society, which submits to it.</p>

<p>The truth is, that Socialism, in this particular, taxes Political
Economy with inconsistency, and with some justice too; for after
having declared that there are no relations between common and
appropriated wealth, Economists have invalidated their own assertion,
and prepared the way for the socialist grievance. They
did so the moment that, confounding value with utility, they
asserted that the materials and forces of nature, that is to say, the
gifts of God, had an intrinsic value, a value inherent in them,—for
value implies, always and necessarily, appropriation. From
that moment they lost the right and the means of logically
vindicating Property.</p>

<p>What I maintain—and maintain with a conviction amounting
to absolute certainty—is this: that the appropriated fund exerts
a constant action upon the fund which is common and unappropriated,
and in this respect the first assertion of the Economists is
erroneous. But the second assertion, as developed and explained
by socialism, is still more fatal; for the action in question does
not take place in a way to make the common fund pass into the
appropriated fund, but, on the contrary, to make the appropriated
fund pass incessantly into the common domain. Property, just
and legitimate in itself, because always representing services,
tends to transform onerous into gratuitous utility. It is the spur
which urges on human intelligence to make latent natural forces
operative. It struggles, and undoubtedly for our benefit, against
the obstacles which render utility onerous. And when the
obstacle has been to a certain extent removed, it is found that, to
that extent, it has been removed to the profit and advantage of
all. Then indefatigable Property challenges and encounters other
obstacles, and goes on, raising, always and without intermission,
the level of humanity, realizing more and more Community,
and, with Community, Equality, among the great family of mankind.</p>

<p>In this consists the truly marvellous Harmony of the natural
social order. This harmony I am unable to describe without
combating objections which are perpetually recurring, and without
falling into wearisome repetitions. No matter, I submit—let the
reader also exercise a little patience on his side. <a id="p243" class="xxpn">[p243]</a></p>

<p>Make yourself master, first of all, of this fundamental idea, that
when, in any case, there is no obstacle between desire and satisfaction
(there is none, for instance, between our eyes and the light
of day)—there is no effort to make, no service to render, either to
ourselves or to other people, and value and Property have no
existence. When an obstacle exists, the whole series comes into
play. First, we have Effort—then a voluntary exchange of efforts
or Services—then a comparative appreciation of those services, or
Value; lastly, the right of each to enjoy the utilities attached to
these values, or Property.</p>

<p>If in this struggle against obstacles, which are always uniform,
the co-operation of nature and that of labour were also always in
equal proportion, Property and Community would advance in
parallel lines, without changing their relative proportions.</p>

<p>But it is not so. The universal aim of men in all their enterprises
is to diminish the proportion between effort and result, and
for that purpose to enlist more and more in their work the assistance
of natural agents. No agriculturist, manufacturer, merchant,
artisan, shipowner, artist, but makes this his constant study. In
that direction all their faculties are bent. For that purpose they
invent tools and machines, and avail themselves of the chemical
and mechanical forces of the elements, divide their occupations,
and unite their efforts. To accomplish more with less, such is the
eternal problem which they propose to themselves at all times, in
all places, in all situations, in everything. Who doubts that in
all this they are prompted by self-interest? What other stimulant
could excite them to the same energy? Every man, moreover,
is charged with the care of his own existence and advancement.
What, then, should constitute the mainspring of his movements
but self-interest? You express your astonishment, but wait till
I have done, and you will find that if each cares for himself, God
cares for us all.</p>

<p>Our constant study, then, is to diminish the proportion which
the effort bears to the useful effect sought to be produced. But
when the effort is lessened, whether by the removal of obstacles or
the intervention of machinery, by the division of labour, the union
of forces, or the assistance of natural agents, etc., this diminished
effort is less highly appreciated in relation to others;—we render
less <em class="e000I2">service</em> in making the effort for another. There is less value,
and we are justified in saying that the domain of Property has
receded. Is the useful effect on that account lost? By hypothesis
it is not. Where then has it gone to? It has passed into the
domain of Community. As regards that portion of human effort
<a id="p244" class="xxpn">[p244]</a> which the useful effect no longer absorbs, it is not on that account
sterile—it is turned to other acquisitions. Obstacles present
themselves, and will always present themselves, to the indefinite
expansibility of our physical, moral, and intellectual wants, to an
extent sufficient to ensure that the labour set free in one department
will find employment in another. And it is in this way that
the appropriated fund remaining always the same, the common
fund dilates and expands, like a circle the radius of which is
always enlarging.</p>

<p>Apart from this consideration, how could we explain progress
or civilisation, however imperfect? Let us turn our regards upon
ourselves, and consider our feebleness. Let us compare our own
individual vigour and knowledge with the vigour and knowledge
necessary to produce the innumerable satisfactions which we derive
from society. We shall soon be convinced that were we
reduced to our proper efforts, we could not obtain a hundred
thousandth part of them, even if millions of acres of uncultivated
land were placed at the disposal of each one of us. It is positively
certain that a given amount of human effort will realize an immeasurably
greater result at the present day than it could in the
days of the Druids. If that were true only of an individual, the
natural conclusion would be that he lives and prospers at the expense
of his fellows. But since this phenomenon is manifested in
all the members of the human family, we are led to the comfortable
conclusion that things not our own have come to our aid;
that the gratuitous co-operation of nature is in larger and larger
measure added to our own efforts, and that it remains gratuitous
through all our transactions; for were it not gratuitous, it would
explain nothing.</p>

<p>From what we have said, we may deduce these formulas:</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Property is Value, and Value is Property;</em></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">That which has no Value is gratuitous, and what is gratuitous is
common;</em></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">A fall of Value is an approximation towards the gratuitous;</em></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Such approximation is a partial realization of Community.</em></p>

<p>There are times when one cannot give utterance to certain words
without being exposed to false interpretations. There are always
people ready to cry out, in a critical or in a laudatory spirit, according
to the sect they belong to: “The author talks of Community—he
must be a Communist.” I expect this, and resign
myself to it. And yet I must endeavour to guard myself against
such hasty inferences.</p>

<p>The reader must have been very inattentive (and the most <a id="p245" class="xxpn">[p245]</a> formidable
class of readers are those who turn over books without
attending to what they read) if he has not observed the great gulf
which interposes itself between Community and Communism. The
two ideas are separated by the entire domain not only of property
but of liberty, right, justice, and even of human personality.</p>

<p>Community applies to those things which we enjoy in common
by the destination of Providence; because, exacting no effort in
order to adapt them to our use, they give rise to no service, no
transaction, no Property. The foundation of property is the right
which we possess to render services to ourselves, or to others on
condition of a return.</p>

<p>What Communism wishes to render common is, not the gratuitous
gift of God, but human effort—service.</p>

<p>It desires that each man should carry the fruit of his labour to
the common stock, and that afterwards an equitable distribution
of that stock should be made by authority.</p>

<p>Now, of two things one. Either the distribution is proportional
to the stake which each has contributed, or it is made upon another
principle.</p>

<p>In the first case, Communism aims at realizing, as regards result,
the present order of things—only substituting the arbitrary
will of one for the liberty of all.</p>

<p>In the second case, what must be the basis of the division?
Communism answers, Equality. What! Equality, without regard
to the difference of pains taken, of labour undergone! You
are to have an <em class="e000I2">equal share</em> whether you have worked six hours or
twelve—mechanically, or with intelligence! Of all inequalities
surely that would be the most shocking; besides it would be the
destruction of all liberty, all activity, all dignity, all sagacity.
You pretend to put an end to competition, but in truth you only
transform it. The competition at present is, who shall work most
and best. Under your regime it would be, who should work worst
and least.</p>

<p>Communism misunderstands or disowns the very nature of man.
Effort is painful in itself. What urges us to make it? It can
only be a feeling more painful still, a want to satisfy, a suffering
to remove, a good to be realized. Our moving principle, then, is
self-interest. When you ask the Communists what they would
substitute for this, they answer, by the mouth of Louis Blanc,
<em class="e000I2">The point of honour</em>, and by that of Monsieur Cabet, <em class="e000I2">Fraternity</em>.
Enable me, then, to experience the sensations of others, in order
that I may know what direction to impress upon my industry.</p>

<p>I should like to have it explained what this point of honour,
<a id="p246" class="xxpn">[p246]</a> this fraternity, which are to be set to work in society at the instigation
and under the direction of Messieurs Louis Blanc and
Cabet, really mean.</p>

<p>But it is not my business in this place to refute Communism,
which is opposed in everything to the system which it is my object
to establish.</p>

<p>We recognise the right of every man to serve himself, or to
serve others on conditions freely stipulated. Communism denies
this right, since it masses together and centralizes all services in
the hands of an arbitrary authority.</p>

<p>Our doctrine is based upon Property. Communism is founded
on systematic spoliation. It consists in handing over to one, without
compensation, the labour of another. In fact, did it distribute
to each according to his labour, it would recognise property, and
would be no longer Communism.</p>

<p>Our doctrine is founded on liberty. In truth, property and
liberty are in our eyes one and the same thing, for that which constitutes
a man the proprietor of his service is his right and power
of disposing of it. Communism annihilates liberty, since it leaves
to no one the free disposal of his labour.</p>

<p>Our doctrine is founded on justice—Communism on injustice.
That follows clearly from what has been already said.</p>

<p>There is only one point of contact, then, between the communists
and us—it is the similarity of two syllables, in the words
<em class="e000I2">communism</em> and <em class="e000I2">community</em>.</p>

<p>But this similarity of sounds should not mislead the reader.
Whilst communism is the negation of Property, we find in our
doctrine of Community the most explicit affirmation and the most
positive demonstration of property.</p>

<p>If the legitimacy of property has appeared doubtful and inexplicable,
even to men who are not communists, the reason is, that
they believe that it concentrates in the hands of some, to the exclusion
of others, those gifts of God which were originally common.
We believe we have entirely dissipated that doubt by
demonstrating that what is common by providential destination
remains common in all human transactions,—the domain of property
never extending beyond that of value—of right onerously
acquired by services rendered.</p>

<p>Thus explained, property is vindicated; for who but a fool could
pretend that men have no right to their own labour—no right to
receive the voluntary services of those to whom they have rendered
voluntary services?</p>

<p>There is another word upon which I must offer some explanation,
<a id="p247" class="xxpn">[p247]</a> for of late it has been strangely misapplied—I mean the word
<em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>. I need not say that I denominate gratuitous, not what
costs a man nothing because he has deprived another of it, but
what has cost nothing to anyone.</p>

<p>When Diogenes warmed himself in the sun, he might be said
to warm himself gratuitously, for he obtained from the divine
liberality a satisfaction which exacted no labour either from himself
or his contemporaries. Nor does the heat of the sun’s rays cease
to be gratuitous when the proprietor avails himself of it to ripen
his corn and his grapes, seeing that in selling his grapes or his
corn he is paid for his own services and not for those of the sun.
This may be an erroneous view (in which case we have no alternative
but to become communists); but at any rate this is the
sense in which I use the word <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>, and this is what it evidently
means.</p>

<p>Much has been said, since the establishment of the Republic, of
<em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> credit, and <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> instruction. But it is evident
that a gross sophism lurks under this phraseology. Can the State
shed abroad instruction like the light of day without its costing
anything to anybody? Can it cover the country with institutions
and professors without their being paid in one shape or another?
Instead of leaving each individual to demand and to remunerate
voluntarily this description of service, the State may lay hold of
the remuneration, taken by taxation from the pockets of the citizens,
and distribute among them instruction of its own selection,
without exacting from them a second remuneration. This is all
that can be effected by government interference—and in this case,
those who do not learn pay for those who do, those who learn little
for those who learn much, those who are destined to manual labour
for those who embrace learned professions. This is communism
applied to one branch of human activity. Under this régime,
of which I am not called upon here to give an opinion, it might
very well be said that <em class="e000I2">instruction is common</em>, but it would be
ridiculous to say that <em class="e000I2">instruction is gratuitous</em>. Gratuitous! Yes,
for some of those who receive it, but not for those who have to
pay for it, if not to the teacher, at least to the tax-gatherer.</p>

<p>For that matter, there is nothing which the State can give
<em class="e000I2">gratuitously</em>; and if the word were not a mystification, it is not
only <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> education which we should demand from the State,
but <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> food, <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> clothing, <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> lodging, etc.
Let us take care. The people are not far from going this length,
and there are already among us those who demand <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> credit,
<em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> tools and instruments of labour, etc. Dupes of a word,
<a id="p248" class="xxpn">[p248]</a> we have made one step towards Communism; why should we not
make a second, and a third, until all liberty, all justice, and all
property have passed away? Will it be urged that instruction
is so universally necessary that we may depart somewhat from
right and principle in this instance? But then, are not food and
sustenance still more necessary than education? <em class="e000I2">Primò vivere,
deinde philosophari</em>, the people may say; and I know not in truth
what answer we can make to them.</p>

<p>Who knows? Those who charge me with Communism for
having demonstrated the natural community of the gifts of God,
are perhaps the very people who seek to violate justice in the
matter of education, that is to say, to attack property in its essence.
Such inconsistencies are more surprising than uncommon. <a id="p249" class="xxpn">[p249]</a></p>

LANDED PROPERTY.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
If the leading idea of this work is well founded, the relations of
mankind with the external world must be viewed in this way:</p>

<p>God created the earth. On it, and within it, he has placed a
multitude of things which are useful to man, inasmuch as they are
adapted to satisfy his wants.</p>

<p>God has, besides, endued matter with forces—gravitation, elasticity,
porosity, compressibility, heat, light, electricity, crystallization,
vegetable life.</p>

<p>He has placed man in the middle of these materials and forces,
which he has delivered over to him gratuitously.</p>

<p>Men set themselves to exercise their activity upon these materials
and forces; and in this way they render service to themselves.
They also work for one another, and in this way render
reciprocal services. These services, compared by the act of exchange,
give rise to the idea of Value, and Value to that of
Property.</p>

<p>Each man, then, becomes an owner or proprietor in proportion to
the services he has rendered. But the materials and forces given
by God to man gratuitously, at the beginning, have continued gratuitous,
and are and must continue to be so through all our transactions;
for in the estimates and appreciations to which exchange
gives rise, the <em class="e000I2">equivalents</em> are <em class="e000I2">human services</em>, not the <em class="e000I2">gifts of God</em>.</p>

<p>Hence it follows that no human being, so long as transactions
are free, can ever cease to be the usufructuary of these gifts. A
single condition is laid down, which is, that we shall execute the
labour necessary to make them available to us, or, if any one
makes this exertion for us, that we make for him an equivalent
exertion.</p>

<p>If this account of the matter be true, Property is indeed unassailable. <a id="p250" class="xxpn">[p250]</a></p>

<p>The universal instinct of mankind, more infallible than the
lucubrations of any individual, had adopted this view of the subject
without refining upon it, when theory began to scrutinize the
foundations of Property.</p>

<p>Theory unhappily began in confusion, mistaking Utility for
Value, and attributing an inherent <em class="e000I2">value</em>, independent of all human
service, to the materials or forces of nature. From that moment
property became unintelligible, and incapable of justification.</p>

<p>For utility is the relation between commodities and our organization.
It necessarily implies neither efforts, nor transactions,
nor comparisons. We can conceive of it <em class="e000I2">per se</em>, and in relation to
man in a state of isolation. Value, on the contrary, is a relation of
man to man. To exist at all, it must exist in duplicate. Nothing
isolated can be compared. Value implies that the person in possession
of it does not transfer it except for an equivalent value.
The theory, then, which confounds these two ideas, takes for
granted that a person, in effecting an exchange, gives pretended
value of natural creation for true value of human creation, utility
which exacts no labour for utility which does exact it; in other
words, that he can profit by the labour of another without working
himself. Property, thus understood, is called first of all a
<em class="e000I2">necessary monopoly</em>, then simply a <em class="e000I2">monopoly</em>,—then it is branded
as <em class="e000I2">illegitimate</em>, and last of all as <em class="e000I2">robbery</em>.</p>

<p>Landed Property receives the first blow, and so it should. Not
that natural agents do not bear their part in all manufactures, but
these agents manifest themselves more strikingly to the eyes of
the vulgar in the phenomena of vegetable and animal life, in the
production of food, and of what are improperly called <em class="e000I2">matières
premières</em> [raw materials], which are the special products of agriculture.</p>

<p>Besides, if there be any one monopoly more revolting than
another, it is undoubtedly a monopoly which applies to the first
necessaries of life.</p>

<p>The confusion which I am exposing, and which is specious in a
scientific view, since no theorist I am acquainted with has got rid
of it, becomes still more specious when we look at what is passing
around us.</p>

<p>We see the landed Proprietor frequently living without labour,
and we draw the conclusion, which is plausible enough, that “he
must surely be remunerated for something else than his work.”
And what can this something else be, if not the fecundity, the
productiveness, the co-operation of the soil as an instrument? It
is, then, the <em class="e000I2">rent of land</em> which we must brand, in the language
<a id="p251" class="xxpn">[p251]</a> of the times, with the names of necessary monopoly, privilege,
illegitimacy, theft.</p>

<p>We must admit that the authors of this theory have encountered
a fact which must have powerfully tended to mislead them.
Few land estates in Europe have escaped from conquest and all its
attendant abuses; and science has confounded the violent methods
by which landed property has been acquired with the methods by
which it is naturally formed.</p>

<p>But we must not imagine that the false definition of the word
<em class="e000I2">value</em> tends only to unsettle landed property. Logic is a terrible
and indefatigable power, whether it sets out with a good or a bad
principle! As the earth, it is said, makes light, heat, electricity,
vegetable life, etc., co-operate in the production of value, does not
capital in the same way make gravitation, elasticity, the wind, etc.,
concur in producing value? There are other men, then, besides
agriculturists who are paid for the intervention of natural agents.
This remuneration comes to capitalists in the shape of Interest,
just as it comes to proprietors in the shape of Rent. War, then,
must be declared against Interest as it has been against Rent!</p>

<p>Property has had a succession of blows aimed at it in the name of
this principle, false as I think, true according to the Economists
and <em class="e000I2">Egalitaires</em>, namely, that <em class="e000I2">natural agents possess or create value</em>.
This is a postulate upon which all schools are agreed. They
differ only in the boldness or timidity of their deductions.</p>

<p>The Economists say that <em class="e000I2">property</em> (in land) <em class="e000I2">is a monopoly</em>, but
a monopoly which is necessary, and which must be maintained.</p>

<p>The Socialists say that <em class="e000I2">property</em> (in land) <em class="e000I2">is a monopoly</em>, but a
monopoly which is necessary, and which must be maintained,—and
they demand compensation for it in the shape of right to
employment [<em class="e000I2">le droit au travail</em>].</p>

<p>The Communists and <em class="e000I2">Egalitaires</em> say that <em class="e000I2">property</em> (in general)
<em class="e000I2">is a monopoly</em>, and must be destroyed.</p>

<p>For myself, I say most emphatically that <em class="e0U003">PROPERTY IS NOT A
MONOPOLY</em>. Your premises are false, and your three conclusions,
although they differ, are false also. <em class="e00S02">Property is not a monopoly</em>,
and consequently it is not incumbent on us either to tolerate it by
way of favour, or to demand compensation for it, or to destroy it.</p>

<p>Let us pass briefly in review the opinions of writers of various
schools on this important subject.</p>

<p>The English Economists lay down this principle, upon which
they appear to be unanimous, that <em class="e000I2">value comes from labour</em>. Were
they consistent in their use of terms, it might be so; but are they
consistent? The reader will judge. He will see whether they
<a id="p252" class="xxpn">[p252]</a> do not always and everywhere confound gratuitous Utility, which
is incapable of remuneration, and destitute of Value, with onerous
Utility, which we owe exclusively to labour, and which according
to them is alone possessed of value.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em class="e00S02">Adam Smith.</em>—“In agriculture nature labours along with man; and <em class="e000I2">although her
labour costs no expense</em>, its produce <em class="e000I2">has its value</em>, as well as that of the most expensive
workmen.”<a
href="#FN_55" id="FNa_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p></div>

<p>Here we have nature producing value. The purchaser of corn
must pay for it, although it has cost nothing to anybody, not
even labour. Who then dares come forward to demand this pretended
<em class="e000I2">value</em>? Substitute for that word the word <em class="e000I2">utility</em>, and all
becomes clear, Property is vindicated, and justice satisfied.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This rent,” proceeds Smith, “may be considered as the produce of those <em class="e000I2">powers
of nature</em>, the use of which the landlord lends to the farmer.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. It (rent!) is
the <em class="e000I2">work of nature</em>, which remains after deducting or compensating <em class="e000I2">everything which
can be regarded as the work of man</em>. It is seldom less than a fourth, and frequently
more than a third of the whole produce. No equal quantity of productive labour
employed in manufactures can ever occasion so great a reproduction. In them
nature does nothing; man does all.”<a
href="#FN_56" id="FNa_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p></div>

<p>Is it possible in as few words to include a greater number of
dangerous errors? At this rate a fourth or a third part of the
<em class="e000I2">value</em> of human subsistence is due <em class="e000I2">exclusively</em> to the power of
nature. And yet the proprietor is paid by the farmer, and the
farmer by the corn-consumer, for this pretended value which
remains after <em class="e000I2">the work of man</em> has been remunerated. And this is
the basis on which it is desired to place Property! And, then,
what becomes of the axiom that <em class="e000I2">all value comes from labour</em>?</p>

<p>Next, we have nature doing nothing in Manufactures! Do
gravitation, the elasticity of the air, and animal force, not aid the
manufacturer? These forces act in our manufactures just as they
act in our fields; they produce gratuitously, not value, but utility.
Were it otherwise, property in capital would be as much exposed
to the attacks of Communism as property in land.</p>

<p><em class="e00S02">Buchanan.</em>—This commentator, adopting the theory of his
master on Rent, is pressed by logic to blame him for having represented
it as advantageous:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In dwelling on the reproduction of rent as so great an advantage to society,
Smith does not reflect that rent is the effect of high price, and that what the landlord
gains in this way, he gains <em class="e000I2">at the expense</em> of the community at large. There is
no absolute gain to society by the reproduction of rent. It is only one class profiting
at the expense of another class.”<a
href="#FN_57" id="FNa_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p></div>

<p>Here the logical deduction makes its appearance—rent is an
injustice.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em class="e00S02">Ricardo.</em>—“Rent is that portion of the produce of the earth <em class="e000I2">which is paid</em> to the
landlord for the use of the <em class="e000I2">original and indestructible powers of the soil</em>.” <a id="p253" class="xxpn">[p253]</a></p></div>

<p>And, in order that there may be no mistake, the author adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is often confounded with the interest and profit of capital.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. It is
evident that a portion only of the money annually to be paid for the improved farm
would be for <em class="e000I2">the original and indestructible powers of the soil</em>, the other portion
would be paid for the use of the capital which had been employed in ameliorating
the quality of the land, and in erecting such buildings as were necessary to secure
and preserve the produce. . .&#160;. In the future pages of this work, then, whenever
I speak of the rent of land, I wish to be understood as speaking of that compensation
which is paid to the owner of land <em class="e000I2">for the use of its original and indestructible
powers</em>.”<a
href="#FN_58" id="FNa_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p><em class="e00S02">M’Culloch.</em>—“What is properly termed Rent is the sum paid <em class="e000I2">for the use of the
natural and inherent powers of the soil</em>. It is entirely distinct from the sum paid for
the use of buildings, enclosures, roads, or other amelioration. <em class="e000I2">Rent is then always
a monopoly</em>.”</p>

<p><em class="e00S02">Scrope.</em>—“The value of land, and its power of yielding Rent, are due to two
circumstances,—1st, The appropriation of <em class="e000I2">its natural powers</em>; 2d, The labour
applied to its amelioration.”</p></div>

<p>We are not kept long waiting for the consequence:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Under the first of these relations <em class="e000I2">rent is a monopoly</em>. It restricts our usufruct
and enjoyment of the gifts which God has given to men for the satisfaction of
their wants. This restriction <em class="e000I2">is just, only in as far as it is necessary</em> for the common
good.”</p></div>

<p>In what perplexity must those good souls be landed who refuse
to admit anything to be necessary which is not just?</p>

<p>Scrope ends with these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When it goes beyond this point, it must be modified on the same principle
which caused it to be established.”</p></div>

<p>It is impossible for the reader not to perceive that these authors
lead us to a negation of Property, and lead us to it very logically,
in setting out with the proposition that the proprietor is paid
for the gifts of God. Here we have rent held up as an injustice
established by Law under the pressure of necessity, and which
laws may modify or destroy under the pressure of another necessity.
The Communists have never gone farther than this.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em class="e00S02">Senior.</em>—“The instruments of production are labour and natural agents. Natural
agents having been appropriated, proprietors <em class="e000I2">charge for their use</em> under the form of
Rent, which is the recompense of no sacrifice whatever, and is received by those
who have neither laboured nor put by, but who merely hold out their hands to
accept the offerings of the rest of the community.”</p></div>

<p>After giving this heavy blow to property, Mr Senior explains
that one portion of Rent resolves itself into the Interest of Capital,
and then adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The surplus is taken by <em class="e000I2">the proprietor of the natural agent</em>, and is his reward, <em class="e000I2">not
for having laboured or abstained</em>, but simply for not having withheld what he was
able to withhold; for having permitted the gifts of nature to be accepted.”</p></div>

<p>You will observe that this is still the same theory. The proprietor
is supposed to interpose himself between the hungry mouth
and the food which God has vouchsafed under the condition of
<a id="p254" class="xxpn">[p254]</a> labour. The proprietor who has co-operated in the work of production,
charges first of all for his co-operation, which is just, and
then he makes a second charge for the work of nature, for the use
of natural agents, for the indestructible powers of the soil, which
is iniquitous.</p>

<p>This theory of the English Economists, which has been farther
developed by Mill, Malthus, and others, we are sorry to find making
its way also on the Continent.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When a franc’s worth of seed,” says <em class="e00S02">Scialoja</em>, “produces a hundred francs’
worth of corn, this augmentation of <em class="e000I2">value</em> is mainly due to the soil.”</p></div>

<p>This is to confound Utility with value; He might just as well
have said, when water which costs only one sou at ten yards’ distance
from the spring, costs ten sous at 100 yards, this augmentation
of value is due in part to the intervention of nature.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em class="e00S02">Florez Estrada.</em>—“Rent is that portion of the agricultural product which
remains <em class="e000I2">after all the costs of production have been defrayed</em>.”</p></div>

<p>Then the proprietor receives something for nothing.</p>

<p>The English Economists all set out by announcing the principle
that <em class="e000I2">value comes from labour</em>, and they are guilty of inconsistency
when they afterwards attribute value to the inherent <em class="e000I2">powers of the
soil</em>.</p>

<p>The French Economists in general make value to consist in
utility; but, confounding gratuitous with onerous utility, they
have not the less assisted in shaking the foundation of Property.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em class="e00S02">J. B. Say.</em>—“Land is not the only natural agent which is productive, but it is
the only one, or almost the only one, that man has been able to appropriate. The
waters of the sea and of our rivers, by their aptitude to impart motion to machines,
to afford nourishment to fishes, to float our ships, are likewise possessed of productive
power. The wind and the sun’s rays work for us; but <em class="e000I2">happily</em> no one has
been able to say, The wind and the sun are mine, and I must be paid for their
services.”</p></div>

<p>M. Say appears from this to lament that any one should be able
to say, The land belongs to me, and I must be paid for the service
which it renders. <em class="e000I2">Happily</em>, say I, it is no more in the power of
the proprietor to charge for the services of the soil than for the
services of the sun and the wind.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The earth,” continues M. Say, “is an admirable chemical workshop, in which
are combined and elaborated a multitude of materials and elements which are produced
in the shape of grain, fruit, flax, etc. Nature has presented to man, <em class="e000I2">gratuitously</em>,
this vast workshop divided into a great number of compartments fitted
for various kinds of production. But certain individual members of society have
appropriated them, and proclaimed,—This compartment is mine,—that other is
mine, and all that is produced in it is my exclusive property. And the astonishing
thing is, that this <em class="e000I2">usurped privilege</em>, far from having been fatal to the community,
has been found productive of advantage to it.”</p></div>

<p>Undoubtedly this arrangement has been advantageous; but
why? Just because it is neither a privilege nor usurped, and
<a id="p255" class="xxpn">[p255]</a> that the man who exclaims, “This domain is mine,” has not had
it in his power to add, “What has been produced on it is my exclusive
property.” On the contrary, he says, “What has been
produced is the exclusive property of whoever desires to purchase
it, by giving me back simply the same amount of labour which
I have undergone, and which in this instance I have saved his
undergoing.” The co-operation of nature in the work of production,
which is gratuitous for me, is gratuitous for him also.</p>

<p>M. Say indeed distinguishes, in the value of corn, the parts
contributed by Property, by Capital, and by Labour. He has
with the best intention been at great pains to justify this first
part of the remuneration which accrues to the proprietor, and
which is the recompense of no labour, either anterior or present;
but he fails; for, like Scrope, he is obliged to fall back on the last
and least satisfactory of all grounds of vindication, <em class="e000I2">necessity</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If it be impossible,” he remarks, “for production to be effected, not only without
land and without capital, but without these means of production previously
becoming <em class="e000I2">property</em>, may it not be said that proprietors of land and capital exercise
a productive function, since, without the employment of these means, production
would not take place?—a convenient function no doubt, but which, in the present
state of society, presupposes accumulation, which is the result of production or
saving,” etc.</p></div>

<p>The confusion here is palpable. The accumulation has been
effected by the proprietor in his character of Capitalist—a character
with which at present we have no concern. But what M. Say
represents as convenient is the part played by the proprietor, in
his proper character of proprietor, exacting a price for the gifts of
God. It is this part which it is necessary to vindicate, and it has
no connexion with either accumulation or saving.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If, then, property in land and in capital” (why assimilate the two?) “be the
fruit of production, I am warranted in representing such property as a working and
productive machine, for which its author, although sitting with his hands across,
is entitled to exact a recompense.”</p></div>

<p>Still the same confusion. The man who constructs a machine
is proprietor of a <em class="e000I2">capital</em>, from which he legitimately derives an
income, because he is paid, not for the labour of the machine, but
for his own labour in constructing it. But <em class="e000I2">land</em>, or <em class="e000I2">territorial</em>
property, is <em class="e000I2">not the result of human production</em>. What right, then,
have we to be paid for its co-operation? The author has here
mixed up two different kinds of property in the same category,
in order that the same reasons which justify the one may serve
for the vindication of the other.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em class="e00S02">Blanqui.</em>—“The agriculturist who tills, manures, sows, and reaps his field,
furnishes labour, without which nothing would be produced. But the action of the
soil in making the seed germinate, and of the sun in bringing the plant to maturity,
are independent of that labour, and co-operate in the formation of the <em class="e000I2">value</em> represented
by the harvest. . . Smith and other Economists pretend that the labour of
<a id="p256" class="xxpn">[p256]</a> man is the exclusive source of value. Assuredly the industry of the labourer is not
the exclusive source of the value of a sack of corn or a bushel of potatoes. His
skill can no more succeed in producing the phenomenon of germination than the
patience of the alchymist could succeed in discovering the philosopher’s stone.
This is evident.”</p></div>

<p>It is impossible to imagine a more complete confusion than
we have here, first between utility and value, and then between
onerous and gratuitous utility.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em class="e00S02">Joseph Garnier.</em>—“The rent of the proprietor differs essentially from the
wages of the labourer and the profits of the capitalist, inasmuch as these two
kinds of remuneration are the recompense, the one of trouble or pains taken, the
other of a privation submitted to, and a risk encountered, whilst Rent is received
by the proprietor <em class="e000I2">gratuitously, and in virtue alone of a legal convention</em> which recognises
and maintains in certain individuals the right to landed property.”—(<em class="e000I2">Eléments
de l’Économie Politique</em>, 2<sup>e</sup> edition, p. 293.)</p></div>

<p>In other words, the labourer and capitalist are paid, in the name
of equity, for the services they render; and the proprietor is paid,
in the name of law, for services which he does not render.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The boldest innovators do not go farther than to propose the substitution of
collective for individual property. <em class="e000I2">It seems to us that they have reason on their side
as regards human right</em>; but they are wrong practically, inasmuch as they are unable
to exhibit the advantages of a better Economical system.”&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;—(<em class="e000I2">Ibid.</em>, pp.
377, 378.)</p>

<p>“But at the same time, <em class="e000I2">in avowing that property is a privilege, a monopoly</em>, we must
add, that it is a natural and a useful monopoly. . .&#160;.</p>

<p>“In short, it seems to be admitted by Political Economy” [it is so, alas! and
here lies the evil] “that property does not flow from divine right, demesnial right,
or any other speculative right, but simply from its utility. <em class="e000I2">It is only a monopoly
tolerated in the interest of all</em>,” etc.</p></div>

<p>This is precisely the judgment pronounced by Scrope, and repeated
in modified terms by Say.</p>

<p>I think I have now satisfactorily shown that Political Economy,
setting out with the false datum, that “natural agents possess or
create value,” has arrived at this conclusion, “that property (in
as far as it appropriates and is remunerated for this value, which
is independent of all human service) is a privilege, a monopoly, a
usurpation; but that it is a necessary monopoly, and must be
maintained.”</p>

<p>It remains for me to show that the Socialists set out with the
same postulate, only they modify the conclusion in this way:
“Property is a necessary monopoly; it must be maintained, but
we must demand, from those who have property, compensation to
those who have none, in the shape of Right to Employment.”</p>

<p>I shall, then, dispose of the doctrine of the Communists, who,
arguing from the same premises, conclude that “Property is a
monopoly, and ought to be abolished.”</p>

<p>Finally, and at the risk of repetition, I shall, if I can, expose the
fallacy of the premises on which all the three conclusions are based,
namely, that <em class="e000I2">natural agents possess or create value</em>. If I succeed in
<a id="p257" class="xxpn">[p257]</a> this, if I demonstrate that natural agents, even when appropriated,
produce, not Value, but Utility, which, passing from the hands of
the proprietor without leaving anything behind it, reaches the
consumer gratuitously,—in that case, all—Economists, Socialists,
Communists—must at length come to a common understanding to
leave the world, in this respect, just as it is.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em class="e00S02">M. Considérant.</em><a
href="#FN_59" id="FNa_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>—“In order to discover how and under what conditions <em class="e000I2">private
property</em> may Legitimately manifest and develop itself, we must get possession of
the <em class="e000I2">fundamental principle of the Right of Property</em>; and here it is:</p>

<p>“Every man <em class="e0U003">POSSESSES LEGITIMATELY THE THINGS</em> <em class="e000I2">which have been</em> <em class="e0U003">CREATED</em> <em class="e000I2">by
his labour, his intelligence, or</em>, to speak more generally, <em class="e0U003">BY HIS ACTIVITY</em>.</p>

<p>“This Principle is incontestable, and it is right to remark that it contains implicitly
the acknowledgment of the Right of all to the Soil. The earth not having
been created by man, it follows in fact, from the fundamental principle of Property,
that the Soil, which is a common fund given over to the species, can in no shape
legitimately become the absolute and exclusive property of this or that individual
who has not created <em class="e000I2">this value</em>. Let us establish, then, the true Theory of Property,
by basing it exclusively on the unexceptionable principle which makes <em class="e000I2">the legitimacy
of Property</em> hinge upon the fact of <em class="e000I2">the</em> <em class="e0U003">CREATION</em> <em class="e000I2">of the thing, or of the value
possessed</em>. To accomplish this we must direct our reasoning to the origin of industry,
that is to say, to the origin and development of agriculture, manufactures,
the arts, etc., in human society.</p>

<p>“Suppose that on a solitary island, on the territory of a nation, or on the entire
surface of the earth (for the extent of the field of action makes no difference in our
estimate of facts), a generation of mankind devotes itself for the first time to industry—for
the first time engages in agriculture, manufactures, etc. Each generation,
by its labour, by its intelligence, by the exertion of its own proper activity,
<em class="e000I2">creates products, develops value</em>, which did not exist on the earth in its rude and
primitive state. Is it not perfectly evident that, among the first generation of
labourers, Property would conform to Right, <em class="e0U003">PROVIDED</em> <em class="e000I2">the value or wealth produced
by the activity of all</em> were distributed among the producers <em class="e0U003">IN PROPORTION TO THE
CO-OPERATION</em> of each in the creation of the general riches? That is beyond
dispute.</p>

<p>“Now, the results of the labour of this generation may be divided into two
categories, which it is important to distinguish.</p>

<p>“The <em class="e000I2">first category</em> includes the products of the soil, which belong to this first
generation in its character of usufructuary, as having been increased, refined, or
manufactured by its labour, by its industry. These products, whether raw or
manufactured, consist either of objects of consumption or of instruments of labour.
It is clear that these products belong, <em class="e000I2">in entire and legitimate property</em>, to those who
have created them by their activity. Each of them, then, has <em class="e0U003">RIGHT</em>, either to consume
these products immediately, to store them up to be disposed of afterwards at
pleasure, or to employ them, exchange them, give them away, or transmit them to
any one he chooses, without receiving authority from anyone. On this hypothesis,
this Property is evidently <em class="e000I2">Legitimate</em>, respectable, sacred. We cannot assail it
without assailing <em class="e000I2">Justice</em>, <em class="e000I2">Right</em>, <em class="e000I2">individual liberty</em>,—without, in short, being guilty
of Spoliation.</p>

<p>“<em class="e000I2">Second category.</em> But the creations attributable to the industrious activity of
this first generation are not all included in the preceding category. This generation
has created not only the products which we have just described (objects of consumption
and instruments of labour),—it has also added an <em class="e000I2">additional value</em> to the
<em class="e000I2">primitive value</em> of the soil, by cultivation, by erections, by the permanent improvements
which it has executed.</p>

<p>“This additional value constitutes evidently a product, a value, due to the
activity of the first generation. Now, if by any means (we are not concerned at
present with the question of means),—if by any means whatever the property of
this additional value is equitably distributed among the different members of
society, that is to say, is distributed among them proportionally to the co-operation
of each in its creation, each will possess <em class="e000I2">legitimately</em> the portion which has fallen to
him. He may, then, dispose of this individual Property, legitimate as he sees it to
be, exchange it, give it away, or transmit it without control, society having over
these values no right or power whatsoever. <a id="p258" class="xxpn">[p258]</a></p>

<p>“We may, therefore, easily conceive that when the second generation makes its
appearance, it will find upon the land two sorts of Capital:</p>

<p>“1st, The <em class="e000I2">primitive or natural capital</em>, which has not been created by the men of
the first generation—that is, the <em class="e000I2">value</em> of the land in its rough, uncultivated state.</p>

<p>“2d, The <em class="e000I2">capital created</em> by the first generation: including (1), the <em class="e000I2">products</em>, commodities,
and instruments, which shall not have been consumed or used by the first
generation; (2), the additional value which the labour of the first generation has
added to the value of the rough, uncultivated land.</p>

<p>“It is evident, then, and results clearly and necessarily from the fundamental
principle of the Right of Property, which I have just explained, that each individual
of the second generation has an equal right to the <em class="e000I2">primitive or natural
capital</em>, whilst he has no right to the other species of <em class="e000I2">capital</em> which has been
<em class="e000I2">created</em> by the labour of the first generation. Each individual of the first generation
may, then, dispose of his share of this <em class="e000I2">created capital</em> in favour of whatever
individual of the second generation he may please to select, children, friends, etc.,
and no one, not even the State itself, as we have just seen, has the slightest right
(on pretence of Property) to control the disposal which, as donor or testator, he
may have made of such capital.</p>

<p>“Observe that on this hypothesis the man of the second generation is already in
a better situation than the man of the first, seeing that, besides his right to the
<em class="e000I2">primitive capital</em>, which is preserved to him, he has his chance of receiving a portion
of the <em class="e000I2">created capital</em>, that is to say, of a value which he has not produced, and
which represents anterior labour.</p>

<p>“If, then, we suppose things to be arranged in society in such a way that,</p>

<p>“1st, The right to the <em class="e000I2">primitive capital</em>, that is, the usufruct of the soil in its
natural state, is preserved, or that an <em class="e0U003">EQUIVALENT RIGHT</em> is conferred on every
individual born within the territory;</p>

<p>“2d, That the <em class="e000I2">created capital</em> is continually distributed among men, <em class="e000I2">as it is produced</em>,
in proportion to the co-operation of each in the production of that capital;</p>

<p>“If, we say, the mechanism of the social organization shall satisfy these two
conditions, <em class="e0U003">PROPERTY</em>, under such a régime, would be established <em class="e0U003">IN ITS ABSOLUTE
LEGITIMACY</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Fact</em> would be in unison with <em class="e000I2">Right</em>.”—(<em class="e000I2">Théorie du droit de propriété
et du droit au travail</em>, 3<sup>e</sup> edition, p. 17.)</p></div>

<p>We see here that the socialist author distinguishes between two
kinds of value, <em class="e000I2">created value</em>, which is the subject of legitimate
property, and <em class="e000I2">uncreated value</em>, which he denominates the <em class="e000I2">value of
land in its natural state</em>, <em class="e000I2">primitive capital</em>, <em class="e000I2">natural capital</em>, which
cannot become individual property but by usurpation. Now, according
to the theory which I am anxious to establish, the ideas
expressed by the words <em class="e000I2">uncreated</em>, <em class="e000I2">primitive</em>, <em class="e000I2">natural</em>, exclude
radically these other ideas, <em class="e000I2">value</em>, <em class="e000I2">capital</em>. This is the error in
M. Considérant’s premises, by which he is landed in this melancholy
conclusion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That, under the régime of Property, in all civilized nations, the common fund,
over which the entire species has a full right of usufruct, has been invaded—has
been confiscated—by the few, to the exclusion of the many. Why, were even a
single human being excluded from his Right to the Usufruct of this common fund,
that very exclusion would of itself constitute an attack upon Right by the Institution
of Property, and that institution, by sanctioning such invasion of right,
would be unjust and illegitimate.”</p></div>

<p>M. Considérant, however, acknowledges that the earth could
not be cultivated but for the institution of individual property.
Here, then, is a <em class="e000I2">necessary monopoly</em>. What can we do, then, to
reconcile all, and preserve the rights which the <em class="e000I2">prolétaires</em>, or men
of no property, have to the primitive, natural, uncreated capital,
and to the value of the land in its rough and uncultivated state? <a id="p259" class="xxpn">[p259]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Why, let Society, which has taken possession of the land, and taken away from
man the power of exercising, freely and at will, his four natural rights on the surface
of the soil,—let this industrious society cede to the individual, in compensation
for the rights of which it has deprived him, the <em class="e000I2">Right to Employment</em>.”—[<em class="e00S02">Le Droit
au Travail.</em>]</p></div>

<p>Now, nothing in the world is clearer than that this theory, except
the conclusion which it seeks to establish, is exactly the
theory of the Economists. The man who purchases an agricultural
product remunerates three things: 1st, The actual labour—nothing
more legitimate; 2dly, the <em class="e000I2">additional value</em> imparted to
the soil by anterior labour—still nothing more legitimate; 3dly,
and lastly, the <em class="e000I2">primitive</em>, or <em class="e000I2">natural</em>, or <em class="e000I2">uncreated capital</em>,—that
gratuitous gift of God, which M. Considérant denominates the
<em class="e000I2">value of the land in its rough and natural state</em>; Adam Smith, the
<em class="e000I2">indestructible powers of the soil</em>; Ricardo, the <em class="e000I2">productive and indestructible
powers of the land</em>; Say, <em class="e000I2">natural agents</em>. <em class="e000I2">This</em> is the part
which has been <em class="e000I2">usurped</em>, according to M. Considérant; <em class="e000I2">this</em> is what
has been <em class="e000I2">usurped</em>, according to J. B. Say. It is <em class="e000I2">this</em> which constitutes
<em class="e000I2">illegitimacy</em> and <em class="e000I2">spoliation</em> in the eyes of the Socialists;
which constitutes <em class="e000I2">monopoly</em> and <em class="e000I2">privilege</em> in the eyes of the Economists.
They are at one as to the <em class="e000I2">necessity</em> and the utility of this
arrangement. Without it the earth would produce nothing, say
the disciples of Smith; without it we should return to the savage
state, re-echo the disciples of Fourier.</p>

<p>We find that in theory, and as regards right (at least with reference
to this important question), the understanding between the two
schools is much more cordial than we should have imagined.
They differ only as to the legislative consequences to be deduced
from the fact on which they agree. “Seeing that property is
tainted with illegitimacy, inasmuch as it assigns to the proprietor
a part of the remuneration to which he has no right; and seeing,
at the same time, that it is necessary, let us respect it, but demand
indemnities. No, say the Economists, although it is a monopoly,
yet seeing that it is a necessary monopoly, let us respect it, and
let it alone.” And yet they urge this weak defence but feebly;
for one of their latest organs, M. J. Garnier, adds, “You have
reason on your side, as regards human right, but you are wrong
practically, inasmuch as you have failed to point out the effects of
a better system.” To which the Socialists immediately reply,
“We have found it; it is the Right to Employment—try it.”</p>

<p>In the meantime M. Proudhon steps in. You imagine, perhaps,
that this redoubtable objector is about to question the
premises on which the Economists and Socialists ground their
agreement. Not at all. He can demolish property without that.
<a id="p260" class="xxpn">[p260]</a> He appropriates the premises, grasps them, closes with them, and
most logically deduces his conclusion. “You grant,” he says,
“that the gifts of God are possessed not only of utility but of
<em class="e000I2">value</em>, and that these gifts the proprietor usurps and sells. Then
Property is theft; and it is not necessary to maintain it; it is not
necessary to demand compensation for it; what <em class="e000I2">is</em> necessary is to
<em class="e000I2">abolish</em> it.”</p>

<p>M. Proudhon has brought forward many arguments against
landed Property. The most formidable one—indeed the only
formidable one—is that with which these authors have furnished
him, by confounding utility with value.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Who has the right,” he asks, “to charge for the use of the
soil,—for that wealth which does not proceed from man’s act? Who
is entitled to the rent of land? The producer of the land, without
doubt. Who made it? God. Then, proprietor, begone.</p>

<p>“ .&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. But the Creator of the earth
does not sell it—he gives it; and in giving it he shows no respect
of persons. Why, then, among all his children, are some treated as
eldest sons, and some as bastards? If equality of inheritance be our
original right, why should our posthumous right be inequality of
conditions?”</p></div>

<p>Replying to J. B. Say, who had compared land to an instrument,
he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I grant it that land is an instrument; but who is the workman? Is it the proprietor?
Is it he who, by the efficacious virtue of the right of property, communicates
to it vigour and fertility? It is precisely here that we discover in what
consists the monopoly of the proprietor,—he did not make the instrument, and he
charges for its use. Were the Creator to present Himself and demand the rent of
land, we must account for it to Him; but the proprietor, who represents himself as
invested with the same power, ought to exhibit his procuration.”</p></div>

<p>That is evident. The three systems in reality make only one.
Economists, Socialists, Egalitaires, all direct against landed proprietors
the same reproach, that of charging for what they have
no right to charge for. This wrong some call <em class="e000I2">monopoly</em>, some
<em class="e000I2">illegitimacy</em>, others <em class="e000I2">theft</em>—these are but different phases of the
same complaint.</p>

<p>Now I would appeal to every intelligent reader whether this
complaint is or is not well founded? Have I not demonstrated
that there is but one thing which comes between the gifts of God
and the hungry mouth, namely, human service?</p>

<p>Economists say, that “Rent is what we pay to the proprietor
for the use of the productive and indestructible powers of the
soil.” I say, No—Rent is like what we pay to the water-carrier
for the pains he has taken to construct his barrow, and the water
would cost us more if he had carried it on his back. In the same
way, corn, flax, wool, timber, meat, fruits, would have cost us more
if the proprietor had not previously improved the instrument which
furnishes them.</p>

<p>Socialists assert that “originally the masses enjoyed their right <a id="p261" class="xxpn">[p261]</a>
to the land on condition of labour, but that now they are excluded
and robbed of their natural patrimony.” I answer, No—they are
neither excluded nor robbed—they enjoy, gratuitously, the utility
contributed by the soil on condition of labour, that is to say, by
repaying that labour to those who have saved it to them.</p>

<p>Égalitaires allege that “the monopoly of the proprietor consists
in this, that not having made the instrument, he yet charges for its
use.” I answer, No—the land-instrument, so far as it is the work
of God, produces <em class="e000I2">utility</em>, and that utility is gratuitous; it is beyond
the power of the proprietor to charge for it. The land-instrument,
so far as it is prepared by the proprietor,—so far as he has laboured
it, enclosed it, drained it, improved it, and furnished it with other
necessary instruments, produces <em class="e000I2">value</em>, and that value represents
actual human <em class="e000I2">services</em>, and for these alone is the proprietor paid.
You must either admit the legitimacy of this demand, or reject
your own principle—the <em class="e000I2">mutuality of services</em>.</p>

<p>In order to satisfy ourselves as to the true elements of the
value of land, let us attend to the way in which landed property
is formed—not by conquest and violence, but according to the
laws of labour and exchange. Let us see what takes place in the
United States.</p>

<p>Brother Jonathan, a laborious water-carrier of New York, set
out for the Far-west, carrying in his purse a thousand dollars, the
fruit of his labour and frugality.</p>

<p>He journeyed across many fertile provinces, where the soil, the
sun, and the rain worked wonders, but which nevertheless <em class="e000I2">were
entirely destitute of value</em> in the economical and <em class="e000I2">practical</em> sense of
the word.</p>

<p>Being a little of a philosopher, he said to himself—“Let Adam
Smith and Ricardo say what they will, <em class="e000I2">value</em> must <em class="e000I2">be something else
than the natural and indestructible productive power of the soil</em>.”</p>

<p>At length, having reached the State of Arkansas, he found a
beautiful property of about 100 acres, which the government had
advertised for sale at the price of a dollar an acre.</p>

<p>A dollar an acre! he said—that is very little, almost nothing.
I shall purchase this land, clear it, and sell the produce, and the
drawer of water shall become a lord of the soil!</p>

<p>Brother Jonathan, being a merciless logician, liked to have a
reason for everything. He said to himself, But why is this land
worth even a dollar an acre? No one has yet put a spade in it,
or has bestowed on it the least labour. Can Smith and Ricardo,
and the whole string of theorists down to Proudhon, be right after
all? Can land have a value independent of all labour, all service,
<a id="p262" class="xxpn">[p262]</a> all human intervention? Must I admit that the productive and
indestructible powers of the soil <em class="e000I2">have value</em>? In that case, why
should they have no value in the countries through which I have
passed? And, besides, since the powers of the soil surpass so
enormously the powers of men, which, as Blanqui well remarks,
can never go the length of creating the phenomena of germination,
why should these marvellous powers be worth no more than a
dollar?</p>

<p>But he was not long in perceiving that this value, like all other
values, is of human and social creation. The American government
demanded a dollar for the concession of each acre; but, on
the other hand, it undertook to guarantee to a certain extent the
security of the acquirer; it had formed in a rough way a road to
the neighbourhood, facilitated the transmission of letters and newspapers,
etc. Service for service, said Jonathan;—the government
makes me pay a dollar, but it gives me an adequate equivalent.
With deference to Ricardo, I can now account naturally for the
value of this land, which value would be still greater if the road
were extended and improved, the post more frequent and regular,
and the protection more efficacious and secure.</p>

<p>While Jonathan argued, he worked; for we must do him the
justice to say that he always made thinking and acting keep
pace.</p>

<p>He expended the remainder of his dollars in buildings, enclosures,
clearances, trenching, draining, improving, etc.; and after
having dug, laboured, sowed, harrowed, reaped, at length came
the time to dispose of his crop. “Now I shall see,” said Jonathan,
still occupied with the problem of value, “if in becoming a landed
proprietor I have transformed myself into a monopolist, a privileged
aristocrat, a plunderer of my neighbour, an engrosser of the bounties
of divine Providence.”</p>

<p>He carried his grain to market, and began to talk with a
Yankee:—Friend, said he, how much will you give me for this
Indian corn?</p>

<p>The current price, replied the other.</p>

<p>The current price! but will that yield me anything beyond the
interest of my capital and the wages of my labour?</p>

<p>I am a merchant, said the Yankee, and I know that I must
content myself with the recompense of my present and former
labour.</p>

<p>And I was content with it when I was a mere drawer of water,
replied the other, but now I am a landed proprietor. The English
and French Economists have assured me that in that character I
<a id="p263" class="xxpn">[p263]</a> ought, over and above the double remuneration you point at, to
derive a profit from the <em class="e000I2">productive and indestructible powers of the
soil</em>, and levy a tax on the gifts of God.</p>

<p>The gifts of God belong to all, said the merchant. I avail myself
of the <em class="e000I2">productive power</em> of the wind for propelling my ships,
but I make no one pay for it.</p>

<p>Still, as far as I am concerned, I expect that you will pay me
something for these powers, in order that Messieurs Senior, Considérant,
and Proudhon, should not call me a monopolist and
usurper for nothing. If I am to have the disgrace, I may at
least have the profit, of a monopolist.</p>

<p>In that case, friend, I must bid you good morning. To obtain
the maize I am in quest of, I must apply to other proprietors, and
if I find them of your mind, I shall cultivate it for myself.</p>

<p>Jonathan then understood the truth, that, under the empire of
freedom, a man cannot be a monopolist at pleasure. As long as
there are lands in the Union to clear, said he, I can never be more
than the simple setter in motion of these famous <em class="e000I2">productive and
indestructible forces</em>. I shall be paid for my trouble, that is all,
just as when I was a drawer of water I was paid for my own
labour, and not for that of nature. I see now very clearly that
the true usufructuary of the gifts of God is not the man who raises
the corn, but the man who consumes it.</p>

<p>Some years afterwards, another enterprise having engaged the
attention of Jonathan, he set about finding a tenant for his land.
The dialogue which took place between the two contracting
parties was curious, and would throw much light on the subject
under consideration were I to give it entire.</p>

<p>Here is part of it:</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Proprietor.</em> What! you would give me no greater rent than the
interest, at the current rate, of the capital I have actually laid out?</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Farmer.</em> Not a cent more.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Proprietor.</em> Why so, pray?</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Farmer.</em> Just for this reason, that, with the outlay of an equal
capital, I can put as much land in as good condition as yours.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Proprietor.</em> That seems conclusive. But consider that when
you become my tenant, it is not only my capital which will work
for you, but also <em class="e000I2">the productive and indestructible powers of the soil</em>.
You will have enlisted in your service the marvellous influences of
the sun and the moon, of affinity and electricity. Am I to give
you all these things for nothing?</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Farmer.</em> Why not, since they cost you nothing, and since you
derive nothing from them, any more than I do? <a id="p264" class="xxpn">[p264]</a></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Proprietor.</em> Derive nothing from them? I derive everything
from them. Zounds! without these admirable phenomena, all my
industry could not raise a blade of grass.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Farmer.</em> Undoubtedly. But remember the Yankee you met at
market. He would not give you a farthing for all this co-operation
of nature any more than, when you were a water-carrier, the housewives
of New York would give you a farthing for the admirable
elaboration by means of which nature supplied the spring.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Proprietor.</em> Ricardo and Proudhon,
however,&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Farmer.</em> A fig for Ricardo. We must either treat on the basis
which I have laid down, <em class="e000I2">or I shall proceed to clear land</em> alongside
yours, where the sun and the moon will work for me gratis.</p>

<p>It was always the same argument, and Jonathan began to see
that God had wisely arranged so as to make it difficult for man to
intercept His gifts.</p>

<p>Disgusted with the trade of proprietor, Jonathan resolved to
employ his energies in some other department, and he determined
to put up his land to <em class="e000I2">sale</em>.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that no one would give him more for it
than it cost himself. In vain he cited Ricardo, and represented
the inherent value of the indestructible powers of the soil—the
answer always was, “There are other lands close by;” and these
few words put an extinguisher on his exactions and on his illusions.</p>

<p>There is, moreover, in this transaction a fact of great Economic
importance, and to which little attention has been paid.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand that if a manufacturer desires, after ten
or fifteen years, to sell his apparatus and materials, even in their
new state, he will probably be forced to submit to a loss. The
reason is obvious. Ten or fifteen years can scarcely elapse without
considerable improvements in machinery taking place. This
is the reason why the man who sends to market machinery fifteen
years old cannot expect a return exactly equal to the labour he
has expended; for with an equal expenditure of labour the purchaser
could, owing to the progress subsequently made, procure
himself machinery of improved construction—which, we may
remark in passing, proves more and more clearly that value is
not in proportion to labour, but to services.</p>

<p>Hence we may conclude that machinery and instruments of
labour have a tendency to lose part of their value in consequence
of the mere lapse of time, without taking into account their
deterioration by use—and we may lay down this formula, that
“<em class="e000I2">one of the effects of progress is to diminish the value of all existing
instruments</em>.” <a id="p265" class="xxpn">[p265]</a></p>

<p>It is clear, in fact, that the more rapid that progress is, the greater
difficulty will the former instruments have in sustaining the rivalry
of new and improved ones.</p>

<p>I shall not stop here to remark the harmony exhibited by the
results of this law. What I desire you to observe at present is,
that landed property no more escapes from the operation of this
law than any other kind of property.</p>

<p>Brother Jonathan experiences this. He holds this language to
the purchaser—“What I have expended on this property in permanent
improvements represents a thousand days’ labour. I
expect that you will, in the first place, reimburse me for these
thousand days’ work, and then add something for the value which
is inherent in the soil and independent of all human exertion.”</p>

<p>The purchaser replies:</p>

<p>“In the first place, I shall give you nothing for the value inherent
in the soil, which is simply utility, which the adjoining property
possesses as well as yours. Such native superhuman utility I can
obtain gratis, which proves that it possesses no value.</p>

<p>“In the second place, since your books show that you have
expended a thousand days’ work in bringing your land to its
present state, I shall give you only 800 days’ labour; and my
reason for it is, that with 800 days’ labour I can now-a-days
accomplish the same improvements on the adjoining land as you
have executed with 1000 days’ labour on yours. Pray consider
that in the course of fifteen years the art of draining, clearing,
building, sinking wells, designing farm-offices, transporting materials,
has made great progress. Less labour is now required to
effect each given result, and I cannot consent to give you ten for
what I can get for eight, more especially as the price of grain has
fallen in proportion to this progress, which is a profit neither to
you nor to me, but to mankind at large.”</p>

<p>Thus Jonathan was left no alternative but to sell his land at a
loss, or to keep it.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the value of land is not affected by one circumstance
exclusively. Other circumstances—such as the construction
of a canal, or the erection of a town—may act in an opposite
direction, and raise its value, but the improvements of which I
have spoken, which are general and inevitable, always necessarily
tend to depress it.</p>

<p>The conclusion to be deduced from all I have said is, that as long
as there exists in a country abundance of land to be cleared and
brought under cultivation, the proprietor, whether he cultivates, or
lets, or sells it, enjoys no privilege, no monopoly, no exceptional
<a id="p266" class="xxpn">[p266]</a> advantage,—above all, that he levies no tax upon the gratuitous
liberality of nature. How could it be so, if we suppose men to be
free? Have not people who are possessed of capital and energy
a perfect right to make a choice between agriculture, manufactures,
commerce, fisheries, navigation, the arts, or the learned professions?
Will not capital and industry always tend to those departments
which give extraordinary returns? Will they not desert those
which entail loss? Is this inevitable shifting and redistribution
of human efforts not sufficient to establish, according to our hypothesis,
an equilibrium of profit and remuneration? Do agriculturists
in the United States make fortunes more rapidly than
merchants, shipowners, bankers, or physicians,—as would necessarily
happen if they received the wages of their labour like other
people, and the recompense of nature’s work into the bargain?</p>

<p>Would you like to know how a proprietor even in the United
States could establish for himself a monopoly? I shall try to
explain it.</p>

<p>Suppose Jonathan to assemble all the proprietors of the United
States, and hold this language to them:</p>

<p>“I desired to sell my crops, and I found no one who would give
me a high enough price for them. I wished then to let my land,
and encountered the same difficulty. I resolved to sell it, but still
experienced the same disappointment. My exactions have always
been met by their telling me, that <em class="e000I2">there is more land in the neighbourhood</em>;
so that, horrible to say, my services are estimated by
the community like the services of other people, <em class="e000I2">at what they are
worth</em>, in spite of the flattering promises of theorists. They will
give me nothing, absolutely nothing, for those productive and indestructible
powers of the soil, for those natural agents, for the
solar and lunar rays, for the rain, the wind, the dew, the frost,
which I was led to believe were mine, but of which I turn out to
be only the nominal proprietor. Is it not an iniquitous thing
that I am remunerated only for my services, and at a rate, too,
reduced by competition? You are all suffering under the same
oppression, you are all alike the victims of anarchical competition.
It would be no longer so, you may easily perceive, if we <em class="e000I2">organized</em>
landed property, if we laid our heads together to prevent anyone
henceforward from clearing a yard of American soil. In that case,
population pressing, by its increase, on a nearly fixed amount of
subsistence, we should be able to make our own prices and attain
immense wealth, which would be a great boon for all other classes;
for being rich, we should provide them with work.”</p>

<p>If, in consequence of this discourse, the combined proprietors
<a id="p267" class="xxpn">[p267]</a> seized the reins of government, and passed an act interdicting all
new clearances, the consequence undoubtedly would be a temporary
increase of their profits. I say temporary, for the natural
laws of society would be wanting in harmony if the punishment
of such a crime did not spring naturally from the crime itself.
Speaking with scientific exactitude, I should not say that the new
law we have supposed would impart value to the powers of the
soil, or to natural agents (were this the case, the law would do
harm to no one);—but I should say, that the equilibrium of services
had been violently upset; that one class robbed all other
classes, and that slavery had been introduced into that country.</p>

<p>Take another hypothesis, which indeed represents the actual
state of things among the civilized nations of Europe—and suppose
all the land to have passed into the domain of private property.</p>

<p>We are to inquire whether in that case the mass of consumers,
or the <em class="e000I2">community</em>, would continue to be the gratuitous usufructuary
of the productive powers of the soil, and of natural agents; whether
the proprietors of land would be owners of anything else than
of its <em class="e000I2">value</em>, that is to say, of their services fairly estimated according
to the laws of competition; and whether, when they are
recompensed for those services, they are not forced like everyone
else to give the gifts of God into the bargain.</p>

<p>Suppose, then, the entire territory of Arkansas alienated by the
government, parcelled into private domains, and subjected to
culture. When Jonathan brings his grain or his land to market,
can he not now take advantage of the productive power of the
soil, and make it an element of value? He could no longer be
met, as in the preceding case, with the overwhelming answer.
“There is more uncultivated land adjacent to yours.”</p>

<p>This new state of things presupposes an increase of population,
which may be divided into two classes: 1st, That which furnishes
to the community agricultural services; 2dly, That which furnishes
manufacturing, intellectual, or other services.</p>

<p>Now this appears to me quite evident. Labourers (other than
owners of land) who wished to procure supplies of grain, being
perfectly free to apply either to Jonathan or to his neighbours, or
to the proprietors of adjoining states, being in circumstances even
to proceed to clear lands beyond the territory of Arkansas, it would
be absolutely impossible for Jonathan to impose an unjust law
upon them. The very fact that lands which have no value exist
elsewhere would oppose to monopoly an invincible obstacle, and
we should be landed again in the preceding hypothesis. Agricultural
services are subject to the law of Universal Competition,
<a id="p268" class="xxpn">[p268]</a> and it is quite impossible to make them pass for more than they
<em class="e000I2">are worth</em>. I add, that they are worth no more (<em class="e000I2">cæteris paribus</em>)
than services of any other description. As the manufacturer, after
charging for his time, his anxiety, his trouble, his risk, his advances,
his skill (all which things constitute human service, and
are represented by value), can demand no recompense for the law
of gravitation, the expansibility of steam, the assistance of which he
has availed himself of,—so in the same way, Jonathan can include
in the value of his grain only the sum total of the personal services,
anterior or recent, and not the assistance he has derived from the
laws of vegetable physiology. The equilibrium of services is not
impaired so long as they are freely exchanged, the one for the
other, at an agreed price; and the gifts of God, of which these services
are the vehicle, given on both sides into the bargain, remain
in the domain of community.</p>

<p>It may be said, no doubt, that in point of fact the value of the
soil is constantly increasing; and this is true. In proportion as
population becomes more dense and the people more wealthy, and
the means of communication more easy, the landed proprietor
derives more advantage from his services. Is this law peculiar
to him? Does the same thing not hold of all other producers?
With equal labour, does not a physician, a lawyer, a singer, a
painter, a day labourer, procure a greater amount of enjoyments in
the nineteenth than he could in the fourth century? in Paris than
in Brittany? in France than in Morocco? But is this increased
enjoyment obtained at the expense of any other body? That is
the point. For the rest, we shall investigate still farther this law
of value (using the word metonymically) of the soil, in a subsequent
part of the work, when we come to consider the theory of Ricardo.</p>

<p>At present it is sufficient to show that Jonathan, in the case we
have put, can exercise no oppression over the industrial classes,
provided the exchange of services is free, and that labour can,
without any legal impediment, be distributed, either in Arkansas
or elsewhere, among different kinds of production. This liberty
renders it impossible for the proprietors to intercept, for their own
profit, the gratuitous benefits of nature.</p>

<p>It would no longer be the same thing if Jonathan and his brethren,
availing themselves of their legislative powers, were to proscribe
or shackle the liberty of trade,—were they to decree, for example,
that not a grain of foreign corn should be allowed to enter the
territory of Arkansas. In that case the value of services exchanged
between proprietors and non-proprietors would no longer be regulated
by justice. The one party could no longer control the <a id="p269" class="xxpn">[p269]</a> pretensions
of the other. Such a legislative measure would be as iniquitous
as the one to which we have just alluded. The effect would be quite
the same as if Jonathan, having carried to market a sack of corn,
which in other circumstances would have sold for fifteen francs,
should present a pistol at the purchaser’s head, and say, Give me
three francs more, or I will blow out your brains.</p>

<p>This (to give the thing its right name) is <em class="e000I2">extortion</em>. <em class="e000I2">Brutal</em> or
<em class="e000I2">legal</em>, the character of the transaction is the same. Brutal, as in
the case of the pistol, it violates property; legal, as in the case
of the prohibition, it still violates property, and repudiates, moreover,
the very principle upon which property is founded. The
exclusive subject of property, as we have seen, is value, and Value
is the appreciation of two services freely and voluntarily exchanged.
It is impossible, then, to conceive anything more directly antagonistic
to the very principle of property, than that which, in the
name of right, destroys the equivalence of services.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place to add, that laws of this description
are iniquitous and injurious, whatever may be the opinions entertained
by those who impose them, or by those who are oppressed
by their operation. In certain countries we find the working-classes
standing up for these restrictions, because they enrich the
proprietors. They do not perceive that it is at their expense, and
I know from experience that it is not always safe to tell them so.</p>

<p>Strange! that people should listen willingly to sectaries who
preach Communism, which is slavery; for when a man is no
longer master of his own services, he is a slave;—and that they
should look askance at those who are always and everywhere
the defenders of Liberty, which is the Community of the gifts of
God.</p>

<p>We now come to the third hypothesis, which assumes that all
the land capable of cultivation throughout the world has passed
into the domain of individual appropriation.</p>

<p>We have still to do with two classes—those who possess land—and
those who do not. Will the first not oppress the second?
and will the latter not be always obliged to give more labour in
exchange for the same amount of subsistence?</p>

<p>I notice this objection merely for argument’s sake, for hundreds
of years must elapse before this hypothesis can become a reality.</p>

<p>Everything forewarns us, however, that the time must at last
come when the exactions of proprietors can no longer be met by
the words, There are other lands to clear.</p>

<p>I pray the reader to remark, that this hypothesis implies another—it
implies that at the same epoch population will have reached
<a id="p270" class="xxpn">[p270]</a> the extreme limit of the means of subsistence which the earth can
afford.</p>

<p>This is a new and important element in the question. It is
very much as if one should put the question, What will happen
when there is no longer enough of oxygen in the atmosphere to
supply the lungs of a redundant population?</p>

<p>Whatever view we take of the principle of population, it is at
least certain that population is capable of <em class="e000I2">increase</em>, nay, that it has
a <em class="e000I2">tendency</em> to increase, since in point of fact it does increase. All
the economic arrangements of society appear to have been organized
with the previous knowledge of this tendency, and are in
perfect harmony with it. The landed proprietor always endeavours
to get paid for the natural agents which he has appropriated,
but he is as constantly foiled in this foolish and unjust pretension
by the abundance of analogous natural agents which have not been
appropriated. The liberality of nature, which is comparatively
indefinite, constitutes him a simple custodier. But now you drive
me into a corner, by supposing a period at which this liberality
reaches its limit. Men have then no longer anything to expect
from that quarter. The consequence is inevitable, that the tendency
of mankind to increase will be paralyzed, that the progress
of population will be arrested. No economic régime can obviate
this necessity. According to the hypothesis we have laid down,
every increase of population would be repressed by mortality.
No philanthropy, no optimism, can make us believe that the
increase of human beings can continue its progression when the
progressive increase of subsistence has conclusively terminated.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have a new order of things and the harmony
of the social laws might be called in question, had they not provided
for a state of matters the existence of which is possible,
although very different from that which now obtains.</p>

<p>The difficulty we have to deal with, then, comes to this: When
a ship in mid-ocean cannot reach land in less than a month, and
has only a fortnight’s provisions on board, what is to be done?
Clearly this, reduce the allowance of each sailor. This is not
cruelty—it is prudence and justice.</p>

<p>In the same way, when population shall have reached the
extreme limit that all the land in the world can maintain, a law
which, by gentle and infallible means prevents the further multiplication
of mankind, cannot be considered either harsh or unjust.
Now, it is landed property still which affords us solution of the
difficulty. The institution of property, by applying the stimulant
of self-interest, causes the land to produce the greatest possible
<a id="p271" class="xxpn">[p271]</a> quantity of subsistence, and by the division of inheritances puts
each family in a situation to estimate the danger to itself of an
imprudent multiplication. It is very clear that any other régime—Communism,
for example—would be at once a less effective spur
to production, and a less powerful curb to population.</p>

<p>After all, it appears to me that Political Economy has discharged
her duty when she has proved that the great and just law of the
<em class="e000I2">mutuality of services</em> operates harmoniously, so long as human
progress is not conclusively arrested. Is it not consoling to think
that up to that point, and under the empire of freedom, it is not
in the power of one class to oppress another? Is economic
Science bound to solve this further problem: Given the tendency
of mankind to multiply, what will take place when there is no
longer room in the world for new inhabitants? Does God hold in
reserve for that epoch some creative cataclasm, some marvellous
manifestation of His almighty power? Or, as Christians, do we
believe in the doctrine of the world’s destruction? These evidently
are not economical problems, and there is no science
which does not encounter similar difficulties. Natural philosophers
know well, that all bodies which move on the surface of the earth
have a tendency to descend, not to ascend. After all, a day must
come when the mountains shall have filled up the valleys, when
the embouchure of our rivers will be on the same level as their
source, when the waters can no longer flow, etc., etc. What will
happen then? Is Natural Science to cease to observe and to
admire the harmony of the actual world because she cannot divine
by what other harmony God will provide for a state of things far
distant, no doubt, but inevitable? It seems to me that at this
point the Economist, like the natural philosopher, should substitute
for an exercise of curiosity an exercise of faith. He who has so
marvellously arranged the medium in which we now live, knows
best how to prepare another medium suitable to other circumstances.</p>

<p>We judge of the productiveness of the soil and of human skill
by the facts of which we are witnesses. Is this a rational mode of
proceeding? Then, adopting it, we may say, Since it has required
six thousand years to bring a tenth part of the earth to the sorry
state of cultivation in which we find it, how many hundreds of
ages must elapse before its entire surface shall be converted into a
garden?</p>

<p>Yet in this appreciation, comforting as it is, we suppose merely
the more general diffusion of our present knowledge, or rather our
present ignorance, of agriculture. But is this, I repeat, an <a id="p272" class="xxpn">[p272]</a> admissible
rule? Does not analogy tell us that an impenetrable veil
conceals from us the power—the indefinite power it may be—of
art? The savage who lives by the chase requires a square league
of territory. What would be his surprise were he told that the
pastoral life enables ten times the number of men to subsist upon
the same space? The nomad shepherd would, in like manner, be
quite astonished to be told that a system of triennial cultivation
[<em class="e000I2">la culture triennale</em>] admits easily of a population ten times greater
still. Tell the peasant accustomed to this routine that the same
progress will again be the result of alternate culture<a
href="#FN_60" id="FNa_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> [<em class="e000I2">la culture
alterne</em>], and he will not believe you. Alternate culture is for us
the latest improvement—Is it the latest improvement for the
human race? Let us comfort ourselves regarding the future
destiny of the species—a long tract of ages is before us. At
all events, let us not require Political Economy to resolve
problems which are not within her domain—and let us with confidence
commit the destinies of future races to the keeping of
that great and good and wise Being who shall have called them
into existence.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Let us recapitulate the ideas contained in this chapter.</p>

<p>These two phenomena, Utility and Value—the co-operation of
nature and the co-operation of man, consequently Community and
Property—are combined in the work of agriculture, as in every
other department of industry.</p>

<p>In the production of corn which appeases our hunger, we remark
something analogous to what takes place in the formation of water
which quenches our thirst. The ocean, which is the theme of the
poet’s inspiration, offers to the Economist also a fine subject of
meditation. It is this vast reservoir which gives drink to all
human creatures. And yet how can that be, when many of them
are situated at a great distance from its shores, and when its water
is besides undrinkable? It is here that we have to admire the
marvellous industry of nature. We mark how the sun warms the
heaving mass, and subjects it to a slow evaporation. The water
takes the form of gas, and, disengaged from the salt, which rendered
it unfit for use, it rises into the high regions of the atmosphere.
Gales of wind, increasing in all directions, drift it towards inhabited
continents. There it encounters cold, which condenses it,
and attaches it in a solid form to the sides of mountains. By-and-by
the gentle heat of spring melts it. Carried along by its weight,
<a id="p273" class="xxpn">[p273]</a> it is filtered and purified through beds of schist and gravel. It
ramifies and distributes itself, and supplies and feeds refreshing
springs in all parts of the world. Here we have an immense and
ingenious industry carried on by nature for the benefit of the
human race. Change of form, change of place, utility, nothing
is wanting. But where is <em class="e000I2">value</em>? Value has not yet come
into existence; and if what we must call the work of God is to
be paid for (it would be paid for if it possessed exchangeable
<em class="e000I2">value</em>)—who could tell the <em class="e000I2">value</em> of a single drop of this precious
liquid?</p>

<p>All men, however, have not a spring of pure water at their
door. In order to quench their thirst they must take pains,
make efforts, exert foresight and skill. It is this <em class="e000I2">supplementary</em>
human labour which gives rise to arrangements, transactions,
<em class="e000I2">estimates</em>. It is here, then, that we discover the origin and
foundation of value.</p>

<p>Man is originally ignorant. Knowledge is acquired. At the
beginning, then, he is forced to carry water, to accomplish the
supplementary labour which nature has left him to execute with
the <em class="e000I2">maximum</em> of trouble. It is at this stage that water has the
greatest <em class="e000I2">value</em> in exchange. By degrees the water-carrier invents
a barrow and wheels, trains horses, constructs pipes, discovers the
law of the siphon, etc.; in short, he transfers part of his labour to
the gratuitous forces of nature; and, in proportion as he does so,
the value of water, but not its utility, is diminished.</p>

<p>There is here, however, a circumstance which it is necessary
thoroughly to comprehend, if we would not see discordance where
there is in reality only harmony. It is this, that the purchaser of
water obtains it on easier terms, that is to say, gives a less amount
of labour in exchange for a given quantity of it, each time that a
step of progress of this kind is gained, although in such circumstances
he has to give a remuneration for the instrument by means
of which nature is constrained to act. Formerly he paid for the
labour of carrying the water; now he pays not only for that, but
for the labour expended in constructing the barrow, the wheel, and
the pipe—and yet, <em class="e000I2">everything included</em>, he pays less; and this shows
us how false and futile the reasoning is which would persuade us
that that part of the remuneration which is applicable to capital is
a burden on the consumer. Will these reasoners never understand
that, for each result obtained, capital supersedes more labour than
it exacts?</p>

<p>All that I have said is equally applicable to the production of
corn. In that case also, anterior to all human labour, there has
<a id="p274" class="xxpn">[p274]</a> been an immense, a measureless, amount of natural industry at
work, the secrets of which the most advanced science can yet give
no account of. Gases, salts, are diffused through the soil and the
atmosphere. Electricity, affinity, the wind, the rain, light, heat,
vegetable life, play successively their parts, often unknown to us,
in transporting, transforming, uniting, dividing, combining these
elements; and this marvellous industry, the activity and utility of
which elude our appreciation and even our imagination, has yet no
<em class="e000I2">value</em>. Value makes its appearance at the first intervention of the
labour of man, who has, in this, more perhaps than in the other
instance we have given, a <em class="e000I2">supplementary</em> labour to perform, in
order to complete what nature has begun.</p>

<p>To direct these natural forces, and remove the obstacles which
impede their action, man takes possession of an instrument, which
is the soil, and he does so without injury to anyone; for this
instrument had previously no value. This is not a matter of
argument, but a matter of fact. Show me, in any part of the
world you choose, land which has not been subjected directly
or indirectly to human action, and I will show you land destitute
of value.<a
href="#FN_61" id="FNa_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> <a id="p275" class="xxpn">[p275]</a></p>

<p>In the meantime, the agriculturist, in order to effect, in conjunction
with nature, the production of corn, executes two kinds of
labour which are quite distinct. The one kind is applicable
directly and immediately to the crop of the year—is applicable
only to that, and must be paid for by that—such as sowing, weeding,
reaping, etc. The other, as building, clearing, draining,
enclosing, is applicable to an indefinite series of crops, and must
be charged to and spread over a course of years, and calculated
according to the tables of interest and annuities. The crops
constitute the remuneration of the agriculturist if he consumes
them himself. If he exchanges them, it is for services of another
kind, and the appreciation of the services so exchanged constitutes
their value.</p>

<p>Now it is easy to see that this class of permanent works executed
by the agriculturist upon the land is a <em class="e000I2">value</em> which has not yet
received its entire recompense, but which cannot fail to receive it.
It cannot be supposed that he is to throw up his land and allow
another to step into his shoes without compensation. The value
has been incorporated and mixed up with the soil, and this is the
reason why we can with propriety employ a metonymy and say
<em class="e000I2">the land has value</em>. It has value, in fact, because it can be no
longer acquired without giving in exchange the equivalent for this
labour. But what I contend for is, that this land, on which its
natural productive power had not originally conferred any value,
<a id="p276" class="xxpn">[p276]</a> has no value yet in this respect. This natural power, which was
gratuitous then, is gratuitous now, and will be always gratuitous.
We may say, indeed, that the land has <em class="e000I2">value</em>, but when we go to
the root of the matter we find, that what possesses value is the
human labour which has improved the land, and the capital which
has been expended on it. Hence it is rigorously exact to say that
the proprietor of the land is, after all, the proprietor only of a
value which he has created, of services which he has rendered;
and what property can be more legitimate? It is property created
at no one’s expense, and neither intercepts nor taxes the gifts of
God.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. The capital which has been advanced, and the
interest of which is spread over the crop of successive years, is so
far from increasing the price of the produce, and forming a burden
on the consumers, that the latter acquire agricultural products
cheaper in proportion as this capital is augmented, that is to say,
in proportion as the value of the soil is increased. I have no
doubt that this assertion will be thought paradoxical and tainted
with exaggerated optimism, so much have people been accustomed
to regard the value of land as a calamity, if not a piece of injustice.
For my own part, I affirm, that it is not enough to say that the
value of the soil has been created at no one’s expense; it is not
enough to say that it injures no one; we should rather say that it
benefits everybody. It is not only legitimate, but advantageous,
even to those who possess no property.</p>

<p>We have here, in fact, the phenomenon of our previous illustration
reproduced. We remarked that from the moment the water-carrier
invented the barrow and the wheel, the purchaser of the
water had to pay for two kinds of labour: 1st, The labour employed
in making the barrow and the wheel, or rather the interest
of the capital, and an annual contribution to a sinking fund to
replace that capital when worn out; 2d, The direct labour which
the water-carrier must still perform. But it is equally true that
these two kinds of labour united do not equal in amount the
labour which had to be undergone before the invention. Why?
because a portion of the work has now been handed over to the
gratuitous forces of nature. It is, indeed, in consequence of this
diminution of human labour that the invention has been called
forth and adopted.</p>

<p>All this takes place in exactly the same way in the case of land
and the production of corn. As often as an agriculturist expends
capital in permanent ameliorations, it is certain that the successive
crops are burdened with the interest of that capital. But it is
<a id="p277" class="xxpn">[p277]</a> equally certain that the other species of labour—rude, unskilled,
present, direct labour—is rendered unnecessary in a still greater
proportion; so that each crop is obtained by the proprietor, and
consequently by the consumer, on easier terms, on less onerous
conditions—the proper action of capital consisting precisely in
substituting natural and gratuitous co-operation for human labour
which must be paid for.</p>

<p>Here is an example of it. In order to obtain a good crop, it is
necessary that the field should be freed from superfluous moisture.
Suppose this species of labour to be still included in the first
category. Suppose that the cultivator goes every morning with a
jar to carry off the stagnant water where it is productive of injury.
It is clear that at the year’s end the land would have acquired no
additional <em class="e000I2">value</em>, but the price of the grain would be enormously
enhanced. It would be the same in the case of all those who followed
the same process while the art of draining was in this primitive
state. If the proprietor were to make a drain, that moment
the land would acquire <em class="e000I2">value</em>, for this labour pertains to the second
category—that which is incorporated with the land—and must be
reimbursed by the products of consecutive years; and no one could
expect to acquire the land without recompensing this work. Is it not
true, however, that it would tend to lower the value of the crop? Is
it not true that although during the first year it exacted an extraordinary
exertion, it saves in the long-run more labour than it has
occasioned? Is it not true that the draining thenceforth will be
executed by the gratuitous law of hydrostatics more economically
than it could be by muscular force? Is it not true that the purchasers
of corn will benefit by this operation? Is it not true
that they should esteem themselves fortunate in this new value
acquired by the soil? And, having reference to more general considerations,
is it not true, in fine, that the value of the soil attests
a progress realized, not for the advantage of the proprietor only,
but for that of society at large? How absurd, then, and suicidal in
society to exclaim: The additional price charged for corn, to
meet the interest of the capital expended on this drain, and ultimately
to replace that capital, or its equivalent, as represented in
the value of the land, is a privilege, a monopoly, a theft! At
this rate, to cease to be a monopolist and a thief, the proprietor
should have only to fill up his drain and betake himself to his jar.
Would the man who has no property, and lives by wages, be any
gainer by that?</p>

<p>Review all the permanent ameliorations of which the sum total
makes up the value of land, and you will find that to each of them
<a id="p278" class="xxpn">[p278]</a> the same remark applies. Having filled up the drain, demolish
the fence, and so force the agriculturist to mount guard upon his
field; destroy the well, pull down the barn, dig up the road, burn
the plough, efface the levelling, remove the artificial mould; replace
in the field the loose stones, the weeds, the roots of trees;
you will then have realized the Utopia of Equality. The land,
and the human race along with it, wall have reverted to the primitive
state, and will have no longer any value. The crops will
have no longer any connexion with capital. Their price will be
freed from that accursed element called interest. Everything,
literally everything, will be done by actual labour, visible to the
naked eye. Political Economy will be much simplified. Our
country will support a man to the square league. The rest of her
inhabitants will have died of hunger;—but then it can no longer
be said that property is a monopoly, an injustice, and a theft.</p>

<p>Let us not be insensible, then, to those economic harmonies
which unfold themselves to our view more and more as we analyze
the ideas of exchange, of value, of capital, of interest, of property,
of community.—Will it indeed be given me to describe the entire
circle, and complete the demonstration?—But we have already,
perhaps, advanced sufficiently far to be convinced that the social
world, not less than the material world, bears the impress of a
Divine hand, from which flows wisdom and goodness, and towards
which we should raise our eyes in gratitude and admiration.</p>

<p>I cannot forbear reverting here to the view of this subject taken
by M. Considérant.</p>

<p>Setting out with the proposition, that the soil has a proper value,
independent of all human labour, that it constitutes <em class="e000I2">primitive and
uncreated capital</em>, he concludes, in perfect consistency with his own
views, that <em class="e000I2">appropriation</em> is <em class="e000I2">usurpation</em>. This supposed iniquity
leads him to indulge in violent tirades against the institutions of
modern society. On the other hand, he allows that permanent
ameliorations confer an <em class="e000I2">additional value</em> on this primitive capital,
an accessory so mixed up with the principal that we cannot separate
them. What are we to do, then? for we have here a total
value composed of two elements, of which one, the fruit of labour,
is legitimate property; and the other, the gift of God, appropriated
by man, is an iniquitous usurpation.</p>

<p>This is no trifling difficulty. M. Considérant resolves it by
reference to the Right to Employment [<em class="e000I2">Droit au travail</em>].</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The development of Mankind evidently demands that the Soil shall not be left
in its wild and uncultivated state. The destiny of the human race is opposed to property
in land retaining <em class="e000I2">its rude and primitive form</em>.</p>

<p>“In the midst of forests and savannas, the savage enjoys four natural rights,
<a id="p279" class="xxpn">[p279]</a> namely, the rights of Hunting, of Fishing, of Gathering the fruits, of Pasturing.
Such is the primitive form of property in land.</p>

<p>“In all civilized societies, the working-classes, the Prolétaires, who inherit
nothing and possess nothing, are simply despoiled of these rights. We cannot
say that the primitive Right has changed its form, for it no longer exists. The
form and the substance have alike disappeared.</p>

<p>“Now in what Form can such Rights be reconciled with the conditions of an industrial
Society? The answer is plain:</p>

<p>“In the savage state, in order to avail himself of his Right, man is <em class="e000I2">obliged to
act</em>. The <em class="e000I2">labour</em> of Fishing, of Hunting, of Gathering, of Pasturing are the conditions
of the exercise of his Right. The primitive Right, then, is a Right <em class="e000I2">to engage
in these employments</em>.</p>

<p>“Very well, let an industrial Society, which has appropriated the land, and
taken away from man the power of exercising freely and at will his four natural
Rights, let this society cede to the individual, in compensation for those Rights,
of which it had despoiled him, the <em class="e000I2">Right to Employment</em>. On this principle,
rightly understood and applied, the individual has no longer any reason to
complain.</p>

<p>“The condition <em class="e000I2">sine quâ non</em>, then, of the Legitimacy of Property is, that Society
should concede to the Prolétaire—the man who has no property—the <em class="e000I2">Right to Employment</em>;
and, in exchange for a given exertion of activity, <em class="e000I2">assure</em> him of means
of subsistence, at least as adequate as such exercise <em class="e000I2">could</em> have procured him in
the primitive state.”</p></div>

<p>I cannot, without being guilty of tiresome repetition, discuss this
question with M. Considérant in all its bearings. If I demonstrate,
that what he terms <em class="e000I2">uncreated capital</em> is no capital at all; that what
he terms the <em class="e000I2">additional value</em> of the soil, is not an additional value,
but the <em class="e000I2">total value</em>; he must acknowledge that his argument has
fallen to pieces, and, with it, all his complaints of the way in
which mankind have judged it proper to live since the days of
Adam. But this controversy would oblige me to repeat all that
I have already said upon the essentially and indelibly gratuitous
character of natural agents.</p>

<p>I shall only remark, that if M. Considérant speaks in behalf of
the non-proprietary class, he is so very accommodating that they
may think themselves betrayed. What! proprietors have usurped
the soil, and all the miracles of vegetation which it displays! they
have usurped the sun, the rain, the dew, oxygen, hydrogen, and
azote, so far at least as these co-operate in the production of
agricultural products—and you ask them to assure to the man
who has no property, as a compensation, at least as much of the
means of subsistence, in exchange for a given exertion of activity,
as that exertion could have procured him in the primitive and
savage state!</p>

<p>But do you not see that landed property has not waited for your
injunctions in order to be a million times more generous? for to
what is your demand limited?</p>

<p>In the primitive state, your four rights of fishing, hunting,
gathering the fruits, and pasturing, maintain in existence, or rather
in a state of vegetation, amid all the horrors of destitution, nearly
one man to the square league of territory. The usurpation of the
<a id="p280" class="xxpn">[p280]</a> land will then be legitimate, according to you, when those who
have been guilty of that usurpation support one man for every
square league, exacting from him at the same time as much
activity as is displayed by a Huron or an Iroquois. Pray remark,
that France consists of only thirty thousand square leagues; that
consequently, if its whole territory supports thirty thousand inhabitants
in that condition of existence which the savage state
affords, you renounce in behalf of the non-proprietary class all
farther demands upon property. Now, there are thirty millions of
Frenchmen who have not an inch of land, and among the number
we meet with many—the president of the republic, ministers,
magistrates, bankers, merchants, notaries, advocates, physicians,
brokers, soldiers, sailors, professors, journalists, etc.—who would
certainly not be disposed to exchange their condition for that of
an Ioway. Landed property, then, must do much more for us than
you exact from it. You demand from it the <em class="e000I2">Right to Employment</em>,
up to a certain point—that is to say, until it yields to the masses—and
in exchange for a given amount of labour, too—as much subsistence
as they could earn in a state of barbarism. Landed
property does much more than that—it gives more than the Right
to employment—it gives Employment itself, and did it only clear
the land-tax, it would do a hundred times more than you ask it
to do.</p>

<p>I find to my great regret that I have not yet done with landed
property and its value. I have still to state, and to refute, in as
few words as possible, an objection which is specious and even
formidable.</p>

<p>It is said,</p>

<p>“Your theory is contradicted by facts. Undoubtedly, as long
as there is in a country abundance of uncultivated land, the existence
of such land will of itself hinder the cultivated land from
acquiring an undue value. It is also beyond doubt, that even when
all the land has passed into the appropriated domain, if neighbouring
nations have extensive tracts ready for the plough, freedom of
trade is sufficient to restrain the value of landed property within
just limits. In these two cases it would seem that the Price of
land can only represent the capital advanced, and the Rent of
land the interest of that capital. Whence we must conclude, as
you do, that the proper action of the soil and the intervention of
natural agents, going for nothing, and not influencing the value of
the crops, remain gratuitous, and therefore common. All this is
specious. We may have difficulty in discovering the error, and
yet this reasoning is erroneous. In order to be convinced of it, it
<a id="p281" class="xxpn">[p281]</a> is sufficient to point to the fact, that there are in France cultivated
lands which are worth from 100 francs to 6000 francs the hectare,
an enormous difference, which is much easier explained by the
difference of fertility than by the difference of the anterior labour
applied to these lands. It is vain to deny, then, that fertility has
its own value, for not a sale takes place which does not attest it.
Every one who purchases a land estate examines its quality, and
pays for it accordingly. If, of two properties which lie alongside
each other, the one consists of a rich alluvium, and the other of
barren sand, the first is surely of more value than the second,
although both may have absorbed the same capital, and to say
truth, the purchaser gives himself no trouble on that score. His
attention is fixed upon the future, and not upon the past. What
he looks at is not what the land has cost, but what it will yield,
and he knows that its yield will be in proportion to its fertility.
Then this fertility has a proper and intrinsic value which is independent
of all human labour. To maintain the contrary is to
endeavour to base the legitimacy of individual appropriation on a
subtilty, or rather on a paradox.”</p>

<p>Let us inquire, then, what is the true foundation of the value
of land.</p>

<p>I pray the reader not to forget that this question is of grave importance
at the present moment. Hitherto it has been neglected
or glossed over by Economists, as a question of mere curiosity.
The legitimacy of individual appropriation was not formerly contested,
but this is no longer the case. Theories which have obtained
but too much success have created doubts in the minds of
our best thinkers on the institution of property. And upon what
do the authors of these theories found their complaints? Why,
exactly upon the assertion contained in the objection which I have
just explained—upon the fact, unfortunately admitted by all
schools, that the soil, by reason of its fertility, possesses an inherent
value communicated to it by nature and not by human
means. Now value is not transferred gratuitously. The very
word excludes the idea of gratuitousness. We say to the proprietor,
then—you demand from me a value which is the fruit of my
labour, and you offer me in exchange a value which is not the
fruit of your labour, or of any labour, but of the liberality of
nature.</p>

<p>Be assured that this would be a fearful complaint were it well
founded. It did not originate with Messieurs Considérant and
Proudhon. We find it in the works of Smith, of Ricardo, of
Senior, of all the Economists without exception, not as a theory
<a id="p282" class="xxpn">[p282]</a> merely, but as a subject of complaint. These authors have not
only attributed to the soil an extra-human value, they have boldly
deduced the consequence, and branded landed property as a
privilege, a monopoly, a usurpation. No doubt, after thus branding
it, they have defended it on the plea of <em class="e000I2">necessity</em>. But what
does such a defence amount to, but an error of reasoning which
the Communist logicians have lost no time in rectifying?</p>

<p>It is not, then, to indulge an unhappy love for subtilties that I
enter on this delicate subject. I should have wished to save both
the reader and myself the ennui which even now I feel hovering
over the conclusion of this chapter.</p>

<p>The answer to the objection now under consideration is to be
found in the theory of Value, explained in the <em class="e000I2">fifth</em> chapter of this
work. I there said that value does not essentially imply labour;
still less is it necessarily proportionate to labour. I have shown
that the foundation of value is not so much the <em class="e000I2">pains taken</em> by the
person who transfers it as the <em class="e000I2">pains saved</em> to the person who receives
it; and it is for that reason that I have made it to reside in
something which embraces these two elements—in <em class="e000I2">service</em>. I have
said that a person may render a great service with very little effort,
or that with a great effort one may render a very trifling service.
The sole result is, that labour does not obtain necessarily a remuneration
which is always in proportion to its intensity, in the case
either of man in an isolated condition, or of man in the social state.</p>

<p>Value is determined by a bargain between two contracting parties.
In making that bargain, each has his own views. You offer
to sell me corn. What matters it to me the time and pains it may
have cost you to produce it? What I am concerned about is the
time and pains it would have cost me to procure it from another
quarter. The knowledge you have of my situation may render
you more or less exacting; the knowledge I have of yours may
render me more or less anxious to make the purchase. There is
no necessary measure, then, of the recompense which you are to
derive from your labour. That depends upon the circumstances,
and the value which these circumstances confer upon the two services
which we are desirous to exchange. By-and-by we shall
call attention to an external force called Competition, whose mission
is to regulate values, and render them more and more proportional
to efforts. Still this proportion is not of the essence of
value, seeing that the proportion is established under the pressure
of a contingent fact.</p>

<p>Keeping this in view, I maintain that the value of land arises,
fluctuates, and is determined, like that of gold, iron, water, the
<a id="p283" class="xxpn">[p283]</a> lawyer’s advice, the physician’s consultation, the singer’s or dancer’s
performance, the artist’s picture—in short, like all other values;
that it is subject to no exceptional laws; that it constitutes
a property the same in origin, the same in nature, and as
legitimate, as any other property. But it does not at all follow,
as you must now see, that, of two exertions of labour applied to
the soil, one should not be much better remunerated than the
other.</p>

<p>Let us revert again to that industry, the most simple of all, and
the best fitted to show us the delicate point which separates the
onerous labour of man from the gratuitous co-operation of nature.
I allude to the humble industry of the water-carrier.</p>

<p>A man procures and brings home a barrel of water. Does he
become possessed of a value necessarily proportionate to his labour?
In that case, the value would be independent of the service the
water may render. Nay more, it would be fixed; for the labour,
once over, is no longer susceptible of increase or diminution.</p>

<p>Well, the day after he procures and brings home this barrel of
water, it may lose its value, if, for example, it has rained during
the night. In that case every one is provided—the water can
render no service, and is no longer wanted. In economic language,
it has ceased to be in demand.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it may acquire considerable value, if extraordinary
wants, unforeseen and pressing, come to manifest themselves.</p>

<p>What is the consequence? that man, working for the future, is
not exactly aware beforehand what value the future will attach
to his labour. Value incorporated in a material object will be
higher or lower, according as it renders more or less service, or, to
express it more clearly, human labour, which is the source of
value, receives according to circumstances a higher or lower remuneration.
Such eventualities are an exercise for foresight, and
foresight also has a right to remuneration.</p>

<p>But what connexion is there, I would ask, between these fluctuations
of value, between these variations in the recompense of labour,
and that marvellous natural industry, those admirable physical
laws, which without our participation have brought the water of
the ocean to the spring? Because the value of this barrel of water
varies according to circumstances, are we to conclude that nature
charges sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes nothing at all,
for evaporation, for carrying the clouds from the ocean to the
mountains, for freezing, melting, and the whole of that admirable
industry which supplies the spring? <a id="p284" class="xxpn">[p284]</a></p>

<p>It is exactly the same thing in the case of agricultural products.</p>

<p>The value of the soil, or rather of the capital applied to the soil,
is made up not of one element but of two. It depends not only
on the labour which has been employed, but also on the ability
which society possesses to remunerate that labour—on Demand as
well as on Supply.</p>

<p>Take the case of a field. Not a year passes, perhaps, in which
there is not some labour bestowed upon it, the effects of which are
permanent, and of course an increase of value is the result.</p>

<p>Roads of access, besides, are improved and made more direct,
the security of person and property becomes more complete,
markets are extended, population increases in number and in
wealth—different systems of culture are introduced, and a new
career is opened to intelligence and skill; the effect of this change
of medium, of this general prosperity, being to confer additional
value on both the present and the anterior labour, and consequently
on the field.</p>

<p>There is here no injustice, no exception in favour of landed
property. No species of labour, from that of the banker to that of
the day-labourer, fails to exhibit the same phenomenon. No one
fails to see his remuneration improved by the improvement of the
society in which his work is carried on. This action and reaction of
the prosperity of each on the prosperity of all, and <em class="e000I2">vice versa</em>, is the
very law of value. So false is the conclusion which imputes to
the soil and its productive powers an imaginary value, that intellectual
labour, professions and trades which have no connexion
with matter or the co-operation of physical laws, enjoy the same
advantage, which in fact is not exceptional but universal. The
lawyer, the physician, the professor, the artist, the poet, receive a
higher remuneration for an equal amount of labour, in proportion
as the town or country to which they belong increases in wealth
and prosperity, in proportion as the taste or demand for their services
becomes more generally diffused, in proportion as the public
is more able and more willing to remunerate them. The acquisition
of clients and customers is regulated by this principle. It is
still more apparent in the case of the Basque Giant and Tom
Thumb, who lived by the simple exhibition of their exceptional
stature, and reap a much better harvest, from the curiosity of the
numerous and wealthy crowds of our large towns, than from that
of a few poor and straggling villagers. In this case, demand not
only enhances value, it creates it. Why, then, should we think it
exceptional or unjust that demand should also exert an influence
on the value of land and of agricultural products? <a id="p285" class="xxpn">[p285]</a></p>

<p>Is it alleged that land may thus attain an exaggerated value?
They who say so have never reflected on the immense amount of
labour which arable land has absorbed. I dare affirm, that there
is not a field in this country which <em class="e000I2">is worth</em> what it has cost, which
could be exchanged for as much labour as has been expended in
bringing it to its present state of productiveness. If this observation
is well founded, it is conclusive. It frees landed property
from the slightest taint of injustice. For this reason, I shall return
to the subject when I come to examine Ricardo’s theory of Rent,
and I shall show that we must apply to agricultural capital the
law which I have stated in these terms: In proportion as capital
increases, products are divided between capitalists or proprietors
and labourers, in such a way that the <em class="e000I2">relative</em> share of the former
goes on continually diminishing, although their <em class="e000I2">absolute</em> share is
increased, whilst the share of the latter is increased both absolutely
and relatively.</p>

<p>The illusion which has induced men to believe that the productive
powers of the soil have an independent value, because they possess
Utility, has led to many errors and catastrophes. It has driven them
frequently to the premature establishment of colonies, the history of
which is nothing else than a lamentable martyrology. They have
reasoned in this way: In our own country we can obtain value only
by labour, and when we have done our work, we have obtained a
value which is only proportionate to our labour. If we emigrate
to Guiana, to the banks of the Mississippi, to Australia, to Africa,
we shall obtain possession of vast territories, uncultivated but
fertile; and our reward will be, that we shall become possessed
not of the value we have created, but also of the inherent and independent
value of the land we may reclaim. They set out, and a
cruel experience soon confirms the truth of the theory which I am
now explaining. They labour, they clear, they exhaust themselves;
they are exposed to privations, to sufferings, to diseases; and then
if they wish to dispose of the land which they have rendered fit
for production, they cannot obtain for it what it has cost them,
and they are forced to acknowledge that value is of human creation.
I defy you to give me an instance of the establishment of a colony
which has not at the beginning been attended with disaster.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Upwards of a thousand labourers were sent out to the Swan River Colony;
but the extreme cheapness of land (eighteenpence, or less than two francs, an
acre) and the extravagant rate of wages, afforded them such facilities and
inducements to become landowners, that capitalists could no longer get any
one to cultivate their lands. A capital of £200,000 (five millions of francs)
was lost in consequence, and the colony became a scene of desolation. The
labourers having left their employers from the delusive desire to become
landowners, agricultural implements were allowed to rust—seeds rotted—and
sheep, cattle, and horses perished for want of attention. A frightful famine
<a id="p286" class="xxpn">[p286]</a> cured the labourers of their infatuation, and they returned to ask employment
from the capitalists; but it was too late.”—<em class="e000I2">Proceedings of the South Australian
Association.</em></p></div>

<p>The association, attributing this disaster to the cheapness of
land, raised its price to 12s. an acre. But, adds Carey, from whom
I borrow this quotation, the real cause was, that the labourers,
being persuaded that land possesses an <em class="e000I2">inherent</em> value, apart from
the labour bestowed on it, were anxious to exercise “the power of
appropriation,” to which the power to demand Rent is attributed.</p>

<p>What follows supplies us with an argument still more conclusive:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In 1836, the landed estates in the colony of Swan River were to be purchased
from the original settlers at one shilling an acre.”—<em class="e000I2">New Monthly
Magazine.</em></p></div>

<p>Thus the land which was sold by the company at 12s.—upon
which the settlers had bestowed much labour and money—was
disposed of by them at one shilling! What then became of the
value of <em class="e000I2">the natural and indestructible productive powers of the soil</em>?<a
href="#FN_62" id="FNa_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>I feel that the vast and important subject of the Value of Land
has not been exhausted in this chapter, written by snatches and
amid many distractions. I shall return to it hereafter; but in the
meantime I cannot resist submitting one observation to my readers,
and more especially to Economists.</p>

<p>The illustrious <em class="e000I2">savants</em> who have done so much to advance the
science, whose lives and writings breathe benevolence and philanthropy,
and who have disclosed to us, at least in a certain aspect,
and within the limits of their researches, the true solution of the
social problem—the Quesnays, the Turgots, the Smiths, the Malthuses,
the Says—have not however escaped, I do not say from
refutation, for that is always legitimate, but from calumny, disparagement,
and insult. To attack their writings, and even their
motives, has become fashionable. It may be said, perhaps, that in
this chapter I am furnishing arms to their detractors, and truly
the moment would be ill chosen for me to turn against those whom
I candidly acknowledge as my initiators, my masters, and my
guides.</p>

<p>But supreme homage is, after all, due to Truth, or what I regard
as Truth. No book was ever written without some admixture
of error. Now, a single error in Political Economy, if we
press it, torture it, deduce from it rigorously its logical consequences,
involves all kinds of errors—in fact, lands us in chaos. There
never was a book from which we could not extract one proposition,
isolated, incomplete, false, including consequently a whole world
<a id="p287" class="xxpn">[p287]</a> of errors and confusion. In my conscience, I believe that the
definition which the Economists have given of the word <em class="e000I2">Value</em> is
of this number. We have just seen that this definition has led
them to cast a serious doubt on the legitimacy of property in land,
and, by consequence, in capital; and they have only been stopped
short on this fatal road by an inconsistency. This inconsistency
has saved them. They have resumed their march on the road
of Truth; and their error, if it be one, is, in their works, an isolated
blot. Then the Socialists have come to lay hold of this false
definition, not to refute it, but to adopt it, strengthen it, make it the
foundation of their propaganda, and deduce from it all its consequences.
Hence has arisen in our day an imminent social danger;
and it is for that reason that I have thought it my duty to be
explicit on this subject, and trace the erroneous theory to its
source. If you conclude that I have separated myself from my
masters Smith and Say, from my friends Blanqui and Garnier,
because, by an oversight in their learned and admirable works, they
have made, as I think, an erroneous application of the word <em class="e000I2">value</em>;
if you conclude from this that I have no longer faith in Political
Economy and Political Economists, I can only protest, and appeal
to the very title of the present volume. <a id="p288" class="xxpn">[p288]</a></p>

COMPETITION.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
There is not in the whole vocabulary of Political Economy a
word which has roused the fury of modern reformers so much as
the word <em class="e000I2">Competition</em>, which, in order to render it the more odious,
they never fail to couple with the epithet <em class="e000I2">anarchical</em>.</p>

<p>What is the meaning of <em class="e000I2">anarchical competition</em>? I really don’t
know. What could we substitute for it? I am equally ignorant.</p>

<p>I hear people, indeed, calling out <em class="e000I2">Organization! Association!</em>
What does that mean? Let us come to an understanding, once
for all. I desire to know what sort of authority these writers
intend to exercise over me, and all other living men; for I acknowledge
only one species of authority, that of reason, if indeed
they have it on their side. Is it their wish then to deprive me of
the right of exercising my judgment on what concerns my own
subsistence? Is their object to take from me the power of comparing
the services which I render with those which I receive?
Do they mean that I should act under the influence of restraint,
exerted over me by them and not by my own intelligence? If
they leave me my liberty, Competition remains. If they deprive
me of freedom, I am their slave. Association will be <em class="e000I2">free and
voluntary</em>, they say. Be it so. But then each group of associates
will, as regards all other groups, be just what individuals now are
in relation to each other, and we shall still have <em class="e000I2">Competition</em>. The
association will be <em class="e000I2">integral</em>. A good joke truly. What! Anarchical
Competition is now desolating society, and we must wait
for a remedy, until, by dint of your persuasion, all the nations of
the earth—Frenchmen, Englishmen, Chinese, Japanese, Caffres,
Hottentots, Laplanders, Cossacks, Patagonians—make up their
minds to unite in one of the forms of association which you have
devised? Why, this is just to avow that competition is indestructible;
and will you venture to say that a phenomenon which
<a id="p289" class="xxpn">[p289]</a> is indestructible, and consequently providential, can be mischievous?</p>

<p>After all, what is Competition? Is it a thing which exists and
is self-acting like the cholera? No, Competition is only the absence
of constraint. In what concerns my own interest, I desire
to choose for myself, not that another should choose for me, or in
spite of me—that is all. And if any one pretends to substitute
his judgment for mine in what concerns me, I should ask to substitute
mine for his in what concerns him. What guarantee have
we that things would go on better in this way? It is evident
that Competition is Liberty. To take away the liberty of acting
is to destroy the possibility, and consequently the power, of
choosing, of judging, of comparing; it is to annihilate intelligence,
to annihilate thought, to annihilate man. From whatever quarter
they set out, to this point all modern reformers tend—to ameliorate
society they begin by annihilating the individual, under the
pretext that all evils come from this source—as if all good did not
come from it too.</p>

<p>We have seen that services are exchanged for services. In
reality, every man comes into the world charged with the responsibility
of providing for his satisfactions by his efforts. When
another man saves us an effort, we ought to save him an effort in
return. He imparts to us a satisfaction resulting from his effort;
we ought to do the same for him.</p>

<p>But who is to make the comparison? for between these efforts,
these pains, these services exchanged, there is necessarily a comparison
to be made, in order to arrive at equivalence, at justice;—unless
indeed injustice, inequality, chance, is to be our rule,
which would just be another way of putting human intelligence
<em class="e000I2">hors de cause</em>. We must, then, have a judge; and who is this
judge to be? Is it not quite natural that in every case wants
should be judged of by those who experience them, satisfactions
by those who seek them, efforts by those who exchange them?
And is it seriously proposed to substitute for this universal vigilance
of the parties interested, a social authority (suppose that of
the reformer himself), charged with determining in all parts of the
world the delicate conditions of these countless acts of interchange?
Do you not see that this would be to set up the most
fallible, the most universal, the most arbitrary, the most inquisitorial,
the most insupportable—we are fortunately able to add, the
most impossible—of all despotisms ever conceived in the brain of
pasha or mufti?</p>

<p>It is sufficient to know that Competition is nothing else than
<a id="p290" class="xxpn">[p290]</a> the absence of an arbitrary authority as judge of exchanges, in
order to be satisfied that it is indestructible. Illegitimate force
may no doubt restrain, counteract, trammel the liberty of exchanging,
as it may the liberty of walking; but it can annihilate
neither the one nor the other without annihilating man. This
being so, it remains for us to inquire whether Competition tends
to the happiness or misery of mankind; a question which amounts
to this,—Is the human race naturally progressive, or are its tendencies
fatally retrograde?</p>

<p>I hesitate not to say that Competition, which, indeed, we might
denominate Liberty, despite the repulsion which it excites, despite
the declamations to which it has given rise, is a law which is democratical
in its essence. Of all the laws to which Providence
has confided the progress of human society, it is the most progressive,
levelling, and <em class="e000I2">communautaire</em>. It is this law which brings
successively into the <em class="e000I2">common</em> domain the use and enjoyment of
commodities which nature has accorded gratuitously only to certain
countries. It is this law, again, which brings into the <em class="e000I2">common</em>
domain all the conquests which the genius of each age
bequeaths to succeeding generations, leaving them only supplementary
labours to execute, which last they continue to exchange
with one another, without succeeding, as they desire, in obtaining
a recompense for the co-operation of natural agents; and if these
labours, as happens always in the beginning, possess a value which
is not proportionate to their intensity, it is still Competition
which, by its incessant but unperceived action, restores an equilibrium
which is sanctioned by justice, and which is more exact
than any that the fallible sagacity of a human magistracy could by
possibility establish. Far from Competition leading to inequality,
as has been erroneously alleged, we may assert that all <em class="e000I2">factitious</em>
inequality is imputable to its absence; and if the gulf between the
Grand Lama and a Paria is more profound than that which separates
the President from an artisan of the United States, the
reason is this, that Competition (or Liberty), which is curbed and
put down in Asia, is not so in America. This is the reason why,
whilst the Socialists see in Competition the source of all that is
evil, we trace to the attacks which have been made upon it the
disturbance of all that is good. Although this great law has been
misunderstood by the Socialists and their adepts; although it is
frequently harsh in its operation, no law is more fertile in social
harmonies, more beneficent in general results; no law attests more
brilliantly the measureless superiority of the designs of God over
the vain and powerless combinations of men. <a id="p291" class="xxpn">[p291]</a></p>

<p>I must here remind the reader of that singular but unquestionable
result of the social order to which I have already invited his
attention,<a
href="#FN_63" id="FNa_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> and which the power of habit hides too frequently from
our view. It is this, <em class="e000I2">that the sum total of satisfactions which falls
to each member of society is much superior to those which he could
procure for himself by his own efforts</em>. In other words, there is an
evident disproportion between our consumption and our labour.
This phenomenon, which all of us can easily verify, if we turn our
regards upon ourselves, ought, it seems to me, to inspire some
gratitude to society, to which we owe it.</p>

<p>We come into this world destitute of everything, tormented with
numerous wants, and provided with nothing but faculties to enable
us to struggle against them. <em class="e000I2">A priori</em>, it would seem that all we
could expect would be to obtain satisfactions proportionate to our
labour. If we obtain more, infinitely more, to what do we owe
the excess? Precisely to that natural organization against which
we are constantly declaiming, when we are not engaged in seeking
to subvert it.</p>

<p>In itself the phenomenon is truly extraordinary. That certain
men consume more than they produce is easily explained, if in one
way or other they usurp the rights of other people—if they receive
services without rendering them. But how can that be true
of all men at the same time? How happens it that, after having
exchanged their services without constraint, without spoliation,
upon a footing of <em class="e000I2">equivalence</em>, each man can say to himself with
truth, I consume in a day more than I could produce in a
century?</p>

<p>The reader has seen that the additional element which resolves
the problem is the co-operation of natural agents, constantly becoming
more and more effective in the work of production; it is
gratuitous utility falling continually into the domain of <em class="e000I2">Community</em>;
it is the labour of heat and of cold, of light, of gravitation,
of affinity, of elasticity, coming progressively to be added to
the labour of man, diminishing the value of services by rendering
them more easy.</p>

<p>I must have but feebly explained the theory of <em class="e000I2">value</em> if the
reader imagines that value diminishes immediately and of its own
accord, by the simple fact of the co-operation of natural forces,
and the relief thereby afforded to human labour. It is not so;
for then we might say with the English Economists that value is
proportional to labour. The man who is aided by a natural and
gratuitous force renders his services more easily; but he does not
<a id="p292" class="xxpn">[p292]</a> on that account renounce voluntarily any portion whatever of his
accustomed remuneration. To induce him to do that, external
coercion—pressure from without—severe but not unjust pressure—is
necessary. It is Competition which exerts this pressure. As
long as Competition does not intervene, as long as the man who
has availed himself of a natural agent preserves his secret, that
natural agent is gratuitous, but it is not yet <em class="e000I2">common</em>. The victory
has been gained, but to the profit only of a single man, or a single
class. It is not yet a benefit to mankind at large. No change
has yet taken place, except that one description of <em class="e000I2">services</em>,
although partly relieved from the pain of muscular exertion, still
exacts all its former remuneration. We have, on the one hand, a
man who exacts from all his fellows the same amount of labour as
formerly, although he offers them a limited amount of his own
labour in return. On the other, we have mankind at large, who
are still obliged to make the same sacrifice of time and of labour
in order to obtain a product now realized in part by nature.</p>

<p>Were things to remain in this state, a principle of indefinite inequality
would be introduced into the world with every new invention.
Not only could we not say that value is proportional to
labour; we could not even say that value tends to become proportional
to labour. All that we have said in the preceding
chapters about <em class="e000I2">gratuitous utility</em> and <em class="e000I2">progressive community</em> would
be chimerical. It would not be true that services are exchanged
against services, in such a way that the gifts of God are transferred
gratuitously from one man to another, down to the ultimate
recipient, who is the consumer. Each would continue to be paid,
not only for his labour, but for the natural forces which he had
once succeeded in setting to work; in a word, society would be
constituted on the principle of universal Monopoly, in place of on
the principle of progressive Community.</p>

<p>But it is not so. God, who has bestowed on all His creatures
heat, light, gravitation, air, water, the soil, the marvels of vegetable
life, electricity, and countless other benefits which it is beyond
my power to enumerate,—God, who has placed in the human breast
the feeling of <em class="e000I2">personal interest</em>, which, like a magnet, attracts
everything to itself,—God, I say, has placed also in the bosom of
society another spring of action, which He has charged with the
care of preserving to His benefits their original destination, which
was, that they should be gratuitous and common. This spring of
action is Competition.</p>

<p>Thus, Personal Interest is that irrepressible force belonging to
the individual which urges us on to progress and discovery, which
<a id="p293" class="xxpn">[p293]</a> spurs us on to exertion, but leads also to monopoly. Competition
is that force belonging to the species which is not less irrepressible,
and which snatches progress, as it is realized, from individual
hands, and makes it the common inheritance of the great family
of mankind. These two forces, in each of which, considered
individually, we might find something to blame, thus constitute
social Harmony, by the play of their combinations, when regarded
in conjunction.</p>

<p>And we may remark, in passing, that we ought not to be at all
surprised that the individual interests of men, considered as
producers, should from the beginning have risen up against
Competition, should have rebuked it, and sought to destroy it—calling
in for this purpose the assistance of force, fraud, privilege,
sophistry, monopoly, restriction, legislative protection, etc. The
morality of the means shows us clearly enough the morality of the
end. But the astonishing and melancholy thing is, that science
herself—false science, it is true—propagated with so much zeal by
the socialist schools, in the name of philanthropy, equality, and
fraternity, should have espoused the cause of Individualism, in its
narrowest and most exclusive manifestation, and should have
deserted the cause of humanity.</p>

<p>Let us see now how Competition acts:—</p>

<p>Man, under the influence of self-interest, is always, and
necessarily, on the outlook for such circumstances as may give
the greatest <em class="e000I2">value</em> to his services. He is not long in discovering
that, as regards the gifts of God, he may be favoured in three
ways:</p>

<p>1. He may appropriate to his own exclusive use these gifts
themselves; or,</p>

<p>2. He may alone know the <em class="e000I2">process</em> by which they can be made
useful; or,</p>

<p>3. He alone may possess the <em class="e000I2">instrument</em> by means of which their
co-operation in the work of production can be secured.</p>

<p>In any of these cases, he gives <em class="e000I2">little</em> of his own labour in
exchange for <em class="e000I2">much</em> of the labour of other men. His services have
a high relative <em class="e000I2">value</em>, and we are led to believe that this excess of
value resides in the natural agent. If it were so, this value would
not be subject to fall. Now, what proves that the value is in the
service is, that we find Competition diminishing both value and
service simultaneously.</p>

<p>1. Natural agents—the gifts of God—are not distributed uniformly
over the different countries of the world. What an infinite
variety of vegetable productions are spread over the wide range
<a id="p294" class="xxpn">[p294]</a> extending from the region of the pine to the region of the palm
tree! Here the soil is more productive, there the heat is more
vivifying. In one quarter we meet with stone, in another with
lime, in another with iron, copper, or coal. Water-power is not
to be found everywhere, nor can we everywhere avail ourselves to
an equal extent of the power of the winds. Distance, from the
objects we find essential, of itself makes a vast difference in the
obstacles which our efforts encounter. Even the human faculties
vary in some measure with climate and races.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that, but for the law of Competition, this
inequality in the distribution of the gifts of God would lead to a
corresponding inequality in the condition of men.</p>

<p>Whoever happened to have within reach a natural advantage
would profit by it, but his fellow-men would not. He would not
permit other men to participate in it through his instrumentality,
without stipulating an excessive remuneration, the amount of
which he would have the power of fixing arbitrarily. He could
attach to his services any value he pleased. We have seen that
the extreme limits between which it must be determined are, the
<em class="e000I2">pains taken</em> by the man who renders the service and the <em class="e000I2">pains
saved</em> to the man who receives it. Competition alone hinders its
being always raised to the maximum. The inhabitant of the
tropics, for example, would say to the European—“Thanks to
the sun’s rays, I can, with labour <em class="e000I2">equal to ten</em>, procure a given
quantity of sugar, coffee, cocoa, or cotton, whilst you, obliged in
your cold climate to have recourse to hot-houses, stoves, and
shelter, cannot obtain the same quantity but with labour equal <em class="e000I2">to a
hundred</em>. You wish to obtain my coffee, sugar, or cotton, and you
would not be sorry were I to take into account in the transaction
only the pains which I have taken, the labour I have expended.
But what I regard principally is the pains, the labour, I have
saved you; for, aware that that is the limit of your resistance, I
make it the limit of my exaction. As what I produce with an
amount of labour equal to <em class="e000I2">ten</em>, you could produce only with labour
equal to <em class="e000I2">a hundred</em>, were I to demand in exchange for my sugar a
commodity which cost you labour equal to 101, you would certainly
refuse; but all that I ask is labour equal to 99. You may
higgle and look gruff for a little, but you will come to my terms;
for at this rate you have still an advantage by the exchange. You
think these terms unfair; but, after all, it is not to you but to me
that God has vouchsafed the advantage of a higher temperature.
I know that I am in a position to take advantage of this gift of
Providence, by depriving you of it unless you pay me a tax, for
<a id="p295" class="xxpn">[p295]</a> I have no competitors. Here, then, are my sugar, my cocoa, my
coffee, my cotton—take them on the conditions I impose—or raise
them for yourself—or do without them.”</p>

<p>It is true that the European might hold to the inhabitant of the
tropics some such language as this: “Turn over your soil, dig pits,
search for iron and coal, and felicitate yourself if you find any; for
if not, it is my determination to push my exactions to an extreme
also. God has vouchsafed to us both precious gifts. We appropriate
as much of them as we require, but we will not suffer others
to touch them without paying us a tax.”</p>

<p>Even if things took place in this way, scientific exactness would
not allow us to attribute to natural agents that Value which resides
only in <em class="e000I2">services</em>. But the error would be harmless, for the
result would be absolutely the same. Services would still be
exchanged against services, but they would exhibit no tendency
to conform to efforts, or labour, as a measure. The gifts of God
would be <em class="e000I2">personal</em> privileges, not <em class="e000I2">common</em> benefits; and we might
perhaps have some reason to complain that the Author of things
had treated us in a way so incurably unequal. Should we, then,
be brethren? Could we regard ourselves as the children of a
common Father? The absence of Competition, that is to say of
Liberty, would in the first instance be an insuperable bar to
Equality. The absence of Equality would exclude all idea of
Fraternity—and nothing of the republican motto<a
href="#FN_64" id="FNa_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> would then be
left.</p>

<p>But let Competition be introduced, and we shall see it instantly
present an insuperable barrier to all such leonine bargains, to all
such forestalling of the gifts of God, to all such revolting pretensions
in the appreciation of services, to all such inequalities with
efforts exchanged.</p>

<p>And let us remark, first of all, that Competition acts forcibly,
called forth as it is by these very inequalities. Labour betakes
itself instinctively to the quarter where it is best remunerated, and
never fails to put an end to this exceptional advantage, so that
Inequality is only a spur which urges us on in spite of ourselves
towards Equality. It is in truth one of the most beautiful <em class="e000I2">final
intentions</em> observable in the social mechanism. Infinite Goodness,
which manifests beneficence everywhere, would seem to have made
choice of the avaricious producer in order to effect an equitable
distribution among all; and truly it is a marvellous sight this, of
self-interest realizing continually what it ever desires to avoid.
Man, as a producer, is necessarily, inevitably, attracted by <a id="p296" class="xxpn">[p296]</a> excessive
returns, which he thus reduces to the ordinary rate. He
pursues his own interest; and without knowing it, without wishing
it, without seeking it, he promotes the general good.</p>

<p>Thus, to recur to our former example, the inhabitant of the
tropics, trafficking in the gifts of God, realizes an excessive remuneration,
and by that very means brings down upon himself
Competition. Human labour exerts itself in proportion to the
magnitude of the inequality, if I may use the expression, and
never rests until that inequality is effaced. Under the action of
Competition, we see the tropical labour, which was <em class="e000I2">equal to ten</em>,
exchanged successively for European labour equal to 80, 50, 40,
20, and finally to 10. Under the empire of the natural laws of
society, there is no reason why this should not take place; that is
to say, there is no reason why services exchanged should not be
measured by the labour performed, the pains taken,—the gifts of
God on both sides being gratuitous and into the bargain. We have
only to consider, in order to appreciate and bless the revolution
which is thus effected. In the first instance, the labour undergone
on both sides is equal, and this satisfies the human mind, which
always desires justice. Then what has become of the gift of God?
Attend to this, reader. No one has been deprived of it. In this
respect we have not allowed ourselves to be imposed upon by the
clamours of the tropical producer. The Brazilian, in as far as he
is himself a consumer of sugar, or cotton, or coffee, never ceases to
profit by the sun’s rays—his good fortune does not cease to aid
him in the work of production. What he has lost is only the unjust
power of levying a tax upon the consumption of the inhabitants
of Europe. The beneficence of Providence, because <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>, has
become, as it ought to become, <em class="e000I2">common</em>; for <em class="e000I2">common</em> and <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>
are in reality the same thing.</p>

<p>The gift of God has become common—and the reader will
observe that I avail myself here of a special fact to elucidate a
phenomenon which is universal—this gift, I say, has become common
to all. This is not declamation, but the expression of a truth
which is demonstrable. Why has this beautiful phenomenon
been misunderstood? Because community is realized under the
form of <em class="e000I2">value annihilated</em>, and the mind with difficulty lays hold
of negations. But I ask, Is it not true that when, in order to
obtain a certain quantity of sugar, coffee, or cotton, I give only
one-tenth of the labour which I should find it necessary to expend
in producing the commodity myself, and this because the Brazilian
sun performs the other nine-tenths of the work,—Is it not true,
I say, that in that case I still exchange labour for labour, and
<a id="p297" class="xxpn">[p297]</a> really and truly obtain, over and above the Brazilian labour, and
into the bargain, the co-operation of the climate of the tropics?
Can I not affirm with rigorous exactitude that I have become, that
all men have become, in the same way as the Indians and Americans,
that is to say gratuitously, participators in the liberality of
nature, so far as the commodities in question are concerned?</p>

<p>England possesses productive coal mines. That is no doubt a
great <em class="e000I2">local</em> advantage, more especially if we suppose, as I shall do
for the sake of argument, that the Continent possesses no coal
mines. Apart from the consideration of exchange, the advantage
which this gives to the people of England is the possession of fuel
in greater abundance than other nations,—fuel obtained with less
labour, and at less expense of useful time. As soon as exchange
comes into operation—keeping out of view Competition—the exclusive
possession of these mines enables the people of England to demand
a considerable remuneration, and to set a high price upon
their labour. Not being in a situation to perform this labour
ourselves, or procure what we want from another quarter, we have
no alternative but to submit. English labour devoted to this
description of work will be well remunerated; in other words,
coal will be dear, and the bounty of nature may be considered as
conferred on the people of one nation, and not on mankind
at large.</p>

<p>But this state of things cannot last; for a great natural and
social law is opposed to it—Competition. For the very reason
that this species of labour is largely remunerated in England, it
will be in great demand there, for men are always in quest of high
remuneration. The number of miners will increase, both in consequence
of the sons of miners devoting themselves to their fathers’
trade, and in consequence of men transferring their industry to
mining from other departments. They will offer to work for a
smaller recompense, and their remuneration will go on diminishing
until it reach the <em class="e000I2">normal rate</em>, or the rate generally given in the
country for analogous work. This means that the price of English
coal will fall in France; that a given amount of French labour
will procure a greater and greater quantity of English coal, or
rather of English labour incorporated and worked up in coal;
and, finally (and this is what I pray you to remark), that the gift
which nature would appear to have bestowed upon England has
in reality been conferred on the whole human race. The coal of
Newcastle is brought within the reach of all men <em class="e000I2">gratuitously</em>, as
far as the mere material is concerned. This is neither a paradox
nor an exaggeration,—it is brought within their reach like the
<a id="p298" class="xxpn">[p298]</a> water of the brook, on the single condition of going to fetch it, or
remunerating those who undertake that labour for us. When we
purchase coal, it is not the coal that we pay for, but the labour
necessary to extract it and transport it. All that we do is to give
a corresponding amount of labour which we have worked up or
incorporated in wine or in silk. So true is it that the liberality
of nature has been extended to France, that the labour which we
refund is not greater than that which it would have been necessary
to undergo had the deposit of coal been in France. Competition
has established equality between the two nations as far as coal is
concerned, except as regards the inevitable and inconsiderable
difference resulting from distance and carriage.</p>

<p>I have given two examples, and, to render the phenomenon
more striking, I have selected international transactions, which are
effected on a great scale. I fear I may thus have diverted the
reader’s attention from the same phenomena acting incessantly
around us in our every-day transactions. Let him take in his
hand the most familiar objects, a glass, a nail, a loaf, a piece of
cloth, a book. Let him meditate on such ordinary products, and
reflect how great an amount of gratuitous utility would never but for
Competition have become <em class="e000I2">common</em> for humanity at large, although
remaining gratuitous for the producer. He will find that, thanks to
Competition, in purchasing his loaf he pays nothing for the action
of the sun, nothing for the rain, nothing for the frost, nothing for the
laws of vegetable physiology, nothing even for the powers of the soil,
despite all that has been said on that subject; nothing for the law
of gravitation set to work by the miller; nothing for the law of
combustion set to work by the baker; nothing for the horse-power
set to work by the carrier; that he pays only for the services
rendered, the pains taken, by human agents; and let him reflect
that, but for Competition, he must have paid, over and above, a
tax for the intervention of all these natural agents; that that tax
would have had no other limit than the difficulty which he might
himself have experienced in procuring the loaf by his own efforts,
and that consequently a whole life would not have been sufficient
to supply the remuneration which would have been demanded of
him. Let him think farther, that he does not make use of a single
commodity which might not give rise to the same reflections, and
that these reflections apply not to him only, but to all mankind,
and he will then comprehend the radical error of those socialist
theories which, looking only at the surface of things, the epidermis
of society, have been set up with so much levity against Competition,
in other words, against human Liberty. He will then regard
<a id="p299" class="xxpn">[p299]</a> Competition, which preserves to the gifts of nature, unequally distributed,
their common and gratuitous character, as the principle
of a just and natural equalization; he will admire it as the force
which holds in check the egotism of individual interest, with
which at the same time it is so artistically combined as to serve
both as a curb to avarice and a spur to exertion; and he will bless
it as a most striking manifestation of God’s impartial solicitude
for the good of all His creatures.</p>

<p>From what has been said, we may deduce the solution of one of
the problems which have been most keenly controverted, namely,
that of free trade as between nation and nation. If it be true, as
seems to me incontestable, that Competition leads the various
countries of the globe to exchange with one another nothing else
than labour, exertion more and more equalized, and to transfer
at the same time reciprocally, and <em class="e000I2">into the bargain</em>, the natural
advantages that each possesses; how blind and absurd must
those men be who exclude foreign products by legislative
measures, under the pretext that they are cheap, and have little
value in proportion to their aggregate utility; that is to say,
precisely because they include a large proportion of gratuitous
utility!</p>

<p>I have said, and I repeat it, that I have confidence in a theory
when I find it in accordance with universal practice. Now, it is
certain that countries would effect many exchanges with each
other were they not interdicted <em class="e000I2">by force</em>. It requires the
bayonet to prevent them; and for that reason it is wrong to
prevent them.</p>

<p>2. Another circumstance places certain men in a favourable
and exceptional situation as regards remuneration—I mean the
personal and exclusive knowledge of the <em class="e000I2">processes</em> by means of
which <em class="e000I2">natural agents</em> can alone be appropriated. What we term
invention is a conquest by human genius; and these beautiful
and pacific conquests, which are, in the first instance, a source of
wealth for those who achieve them, become by-and-by, under the
action of Competition, the <em class="e000I2">common and gratuitous</em> patrimony
of all.</p>

<p>The forces of nature belong indeed to all. Gravitation, for
instance, is common property; it surrounds us, pervades us,
commands us. And yet were there but one mode of making
gravitation co-operate towards a useful and determinate result,
and but one man acquainted with that mode, this man might set
a high price upon his work, or refuse to work except in exchange
for a very high remuneration. His demands would have no limit
<a id="p300" class="xxpn">[p300]</a> until they reached the point at which the consumers must make
greater sacrifices than the old processes entailed upon them. He
may have contrived, for example, to annihilate nine-tenths of the
labour necessary to produce a certain commodity, <em class="e000I2">x</em>. But <em class="e000I2">x</em> has
at present a current market-price determined by the labour which
its production by the ordinary methods exacts. The inventor
sells <em class="e000I2">x</em> at the market-price; in other words, his labour receives a
recompense ten times higher than that of his rivals. This is the
first phase of the invention.</p>

<p>So far we discover nothing unjust or unfair. It is just and
equitable that the man who makes the world acquainted with a
useful process should be rewarded for it;—<em class="e000I2">A chacun selon sa
capacité</em>.</p>

<p>Observe, too, that as yet mankind, with the exception of the
inventor, have gained nothing unless virtually, and in perspective,
so to speak, since in order to procure the commodity <em class="e000I2">x</em>, each
acquirer must make a sacrifice equal to the former cost.</p>

<p>Now, however, the invention enters its second phase—that of
<em class="e000I2">imitation</em>. Excessive remuneration awakens covetousness. The
new process is more generally adopted; the price of the commodity
<em class="e000I2">x</em> continues to fall, and the remuneration goes on diminishing in
proportion as the imitation becomes more distant in date from the
original invention, that is to say, in proportion as it becomes more
easy, and for that reason less meritorious. Surely there is nothing
in all this that cannot be avowed by a legislation the most
advanced and the most impartial.</p>

<p>At length the invention reaches its third phase, its final stage,
that of universal <em class="e000I2">diffusion</em>, when it becomes <em class="e000I2">common</em> and <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>.
The cycle has been completed when Competition has brought back
the remuneration of the producers of <em class="e000I2">x</em> to the general and normal
rate yielded by all analogous work. Then the nine-tenths of the
labour, which by the hypothesis we supposed to be saved by the
invention, become an acquisition to mankind at large. The utility
of the commodity <em class="e000I2">x</em> remains the same; but nine-tenths of that
commodity are now the product of gravitation, a force which was
formerly common to all in principle, but has now become common
to all in this special application. So true is this, that all the consumers
of that commodity throughout the world may now acquire
it with one-tenth of the labour which it formerly cost. The surplus
labour has been entirely annihilated by the new process.</p>

<p>If we consider that there is no human invention which has not
described this circle, that <em class="e000I2">x</em> is here an algebraical sign which represents
corn, clothing, books, ships,—in the production of which an
<a id="p301" class="xxpn">[p301]</a> incalculable amount of Labour or Value has been annihilated, by
the plough, the spinning-jenny, the printing-press, and the sail;
that this observation is applicable to the humblest of tools as well
as to the most complicated mechanism, to the nail, the wedge, the
lever, as well as to the steam-engine and the electric telegraph,
we shall come, I trust, to understand the solution of this grand
problem of human society, <em class="e000I2">that an amount of utility and enjoyment,
always greater, and more and more equally distributed, comes to
remunerate each determinate quantity of human labour</em>.</p>

<p>3. I have shown how Competition brings into the domain of the
<em class="e000I2">common and gratuitous</em> both <em class="e000I2">natural agents</em> and the <em class="e000I2">processes</em> by
which they are made operative. It remains to show that Competition
executes the same function with reference to the instruments
by means of which we set these agents to work. It is not enough
that there should exist in nature a force, such as heat, light,
gravitation, electricity; it is not enough that intelligence conceives
the means of making that force available;—there must
be <em class="e000I2">instruments</em> to realize this conception of the mind, and <em class="e000I2">provisions</em>
to maintain those who devote themselves to it during the
operation.</p>

<p>As regards remuneration, there is a third circumstance which
favours a man, or a class of men, namely, the possession of <em class="e000I2">Capital</em>.
The man who has in his hands the tools necessary for labour, the
materials to work upon, and the provisions for his subsistence
during the operation, is in a situation to determine his own remuneration.
The principle of this is equitable, for capital is only
anterior labour which has not yet been remunerated. The capitalist
is in a good position to impose terms; but observe that,
even when free from Competition, there is a limit which his
demands never can exceed—this limit is the point at which his
remuneration would absorb all the advantages of the service
which he renders. In these circumstances, it is unreasonable to
talk, as is so often done, of the <em class="e000I2">tyranny of capital</em>, seeing that even
in the most extreme cases neither its presence nor its absence can
injure the condition of the labourer. Like the inhabitant of the
tropics, who has an intensity of heat at his disposal which nature
has denied to colder regions—or like the inventor, who possesses
the secret of a process unknown to other men—all that the capitalist
can say is: “Would you profit by my labour—I set such a
price upon it; if you find it too high, do as you have done hitherto—do
without it.”</p>

<p>But Competition takes place among capitalists. Tools, materials,
and provisions, contribute to the creation of utilities only
<a id="p302" class="xxpn">[p302]</a> when employed. There is an emulation, then, among capitalists
to find employment for their capital. All that this emulation
forces them to abate from the extreme demand, of which I have
just assigned the limits, resolving itself into a reduction of the
price of the commodity, is so much clear profit, so much <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>
gain, for the consumer, that is to say, for mankind.</p>

<p>This gain, however, can clearly never be <em class="e000I2">absolutely gratuitous</em>;
for, since capital represents labour, that capital must always
possess in itself the principle of remuneration.</p>

<p>Transactions relative to Capital are subject to the universal law
of exchanges; and exchanges take place only because there is an
advantage for the two contracting parties in effecting them,—an
advantage which has no doubt a tendency to be equalized, but which
accidentally may be greater for the one than for the other. There
is a limit to the remuneration of capital, beyond which limit no one
will consent to borrow it. This limit is the minimum of service
for the borrower. In the same way, there is a limit beyond
which no one will consent to lend, and this limit is the minimum
of remuneration for the lender. This is self-evident. If the
requirements of one of the contracting parties are pushed so far as
to reduce to zero the benefit to be derived by the other from the
transaction, the loan becomes impossible. The remuneration of
capital oscillates between these two extreme terms, pressed towards
the maximum by the Competition of borrowers, brought back
towards the minimum by the Competition of lenders; so that, by
a necessity which is in harmony with justice, it rises when capital
is scarce, and falls when it is abundant.</p>

<p>Many Economists imagine that the number of borrowers increases
more rapidly than it is possible to create capital to lend to
them, whence it would follow that the natural tendency of interest
is to rise. The <em class="e000I2">fact</em> is decidedly the other way, and on all sides
accordingly we perceive civilisation lowering the return for capital.
This return, it is said, is 30 or 40 per cent. at Rome, 20 per cent.
in Brazil, 10 per cent. in Algeria, 8 per cent. in Spain, 6 per cent.
in Italy, 5 per cent. in Germany, 4 per cent. in France, 3 per cent.
in England, and still less in Holland. Now all that part of the
return for capital which is annihilated by progress, although lost to
the capitalist, is not lost to mankind. If interest, originally at 40
per cent., is reduced to 2 per cent., all commodities will be freed
from 38 parts in 40 of this element of cost. They will reach
the consumer freed from this charge to the extent of nineteen-twentieths.
This is a force which, like <em class="e000I2">natural agents</em>, like
expeditive <em class="e000I2">processes</em>, resolves itself into <em class="e000I2">abundance</em>, <em class="e000I2">equalization</em>,
<a id="p303" class="xxpn">[p303]</a> and, finally, into an elevation of the general level of the human
race.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>I have still to say a few words on the Competition of labourer
with labourer,—a subject which in these days has given rise to so
much sentimental declamation. But have we not already exhausted
this subject? I have shown that, owing to the action of Competition,
men cannot long receive an exceptional remuneration for
the co-operation of <em class="e000I2">natural forces</em>, for their acquaintance with new
<em class="e000I2">processes</em>, or for the possession of <em class="e000I2">instruments</em> by means of which
they avail themselves of these forces. This proves that efforts
have a tendency to be exchanged on a footing of equality, or, in
other words, that value tends to become proportionate to labour.
Then I do not see what can justly be termed the Competition of
labourers; still less do I see how it can injure their condition,
since in this point of view workmen are themselves the consumers.
The working class means everybody, and it is precisely this vast
community which reaps ultimately the benefits of Competition,
and all the advantage of values successively annihilated by progress.</p>

<p>The evolution is this: Services are exchanged against services,
values against values. When a man (or a class) appropriates a
natural agent or a new process, his demands are regulated, not by
the labour which he undergoes, but by the labour which he saves
to others. He presses his exactions to the extreme limit, without
ever being able to injure the condition of others. He sets the
greatest possible value on his services. But gradually, by the
operation of Competition, this value tends to become proportioned
to the labour performed; so that the evolution is brought to a
conclusion when equal labour is exchanged for equal labour, both
serving as the vehicle of an ever-increasing amount of gratuitous
utility, to the benefit of the community at large. In such circumstances,
to assert that Competition can be injurious to the labourer,
would be to fall into a palpable contradiction.</p>

<p>And yet this is constantly asserted, and constantly believed;
and why? Because by the word labourer is understood not the
great labouring community, but a particular class. You divide
the community into two classes. On one side you place all those
who are possessed of capital, who live wholly or partly on anterior
labour, or by intellectual labour, or the proceeds of taxation; on
the other, you place those who have nothing but their hands,
who live by wages, or—to use the consecrated expression—the
<em class="e000I2">prolétaires</em>. You look to the relative position of these two classes,
<a id="p304" class="xxpn">[p304]</a> and you ask if, in that relative position, the Competition which
takes place among those who live by wages is not fatal to them?</p>

<p>The situation of men of this last class, it is said, is essentially
precarious. As they receive their wages from day to day, they
live from hand to mouth. In the discussion which, under a free
régime, precedes every bargain, they cannot wait; they must find
work for to-morrow on any terms, under pain of death. If this be
not strictly true of them all, it is at least true of many of them,
and that is enough to depress the entire class; for those who are
the most pressed and the poorest capitulate first, and establish the
general rate of wages. The result is, that wages tend to fall to
the lowest rate which is compatible with bare subsistence—and in
this state of things, the occurrence of the least excess of Competition
among the labourers is a veritable calamity, for, as regards
them, the question is not one of diminished prosperity, but of
simple existence.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly there is much that is true, much that is too true,
<em class="e000I2">in fact</em>, in this description. To deny the sufferings and wretchedness
of that class of men who bear so material a part in the business
of production, would be to shut our eyes to the light of day.
It is, in fact, this deplorable condition of a great number of our
brethren which forms the subject of what has been justly called the
<em class="e000I2">social problem</em>; for although other classes of society are visited also
with disquietudes, sufferings, sudden changes of fortune, commercial
crises, and economic convulsions, it may nevertheless be said
with truth that <em class="e000I2">liberty</em> would be accepted as a solution of the
problem, did mere liberty not appear powerless to cure that rankling
sore which we denominate Pauperism.</p>

<p>And although it is here, pre-eminently, that the social problem
lies, the reader will not expect that I should enter upon
it in this place. Its solution, please God, may be the result
of the entire work, but it clearly cannot be the result of a single
chapter.</p>

<p>I am at present engaged in the exposition of general laws, which
I believe to be harmonious; and I trust the reader will now
begin to be convinced that these laws exist, and that their action
tends towards community, and consequently towards equality.
But I have not denied that the action of these laws is profoundly
troubled by disturbing causes. If, then, we now encounter inequality
as a stubborn <em class="e000I2">fact</em>, how can we be in circumstances to form
a judgment regarding it until we have first of all investigated the
regular laws of the social order, and the causes which disturb the
action of these laws? <a id="p305" class="xxpn">[p305]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, I have ignored neither the existence of evil
nor its mission. I have ventured to assert, that <em class="e000I2">free-will</em> having
been vouchsafed to man, it is not necessary to confine the term
<em class="e000I2">harmony</em> to an aggregate from which evil should be excluded;
for free-will implies error, at least possible error, and error is evil.
Social harmony, like everything which concerns man, is relative.
Evil is a necessary part of the machinery destined to overcome
error, ignorance, injustice, by bringing into play two great laws
of our nature—responsibility and solidarity.</p>

<p>Now, taking pauperism as an existing fact, are we to impute it
to the natural laws which govern the social order,—or to human
institutions which act in a sense contrary to these laws,—or, finally,
to the people themselves, who are the victims, and who, by their
errors and their faults, have brought down this severe chastisement
on their own heads?</p>

<p>In other words, does pauperism exist by providential destination,—or,
on the contrary, by what remains of the artificial in our
political organization,—or as a personal retribution? Fatality,
Injustice, Responsibility—to which of these three causes must we
attribute this frightful sore?</p>

<p>I hesitate not to assert that it cannot be the result of the
natural laws which have hitherto been the subject of our investigations,
seeing that these laws all tend to equalization by amelioration;
that is to say, to bring all men to one and the same level,
which level is continually rising. This, then, is not the place to
seek a solution of the problem of pauperism.</p>

<p>At present, if we would consider specially that class of labourers
who execute the most material portion of the work of production,
and who, in general, having no interest in the profits, live upon a
fixed remuneration called <em class="e000I2">wages</em>, the question we have to investigate
is this: Apart from the consideration of good or bad economic
institutions—apart from the consideration of the evils which the
men who live by wages [the <em class="e000I2">prolétaires</em>] bring upon themselves
by their faults—what is, as regards them, the proper effect of
Competition?</p>

<p>For this class, as for all, the operation of Competition is twofold.
They feel it both as buyers and as sellers of services. The error
of those who write upon these subjects is never to look but at one
side of the question, like natural philosophers, who, if they took
into account only centrifugal force, would never cease to believe
and to prophesy that all was over with us. Grant their false
datum, and you will see with what irrefragable logic they conduct
you to this sinister conclusion. The same may be said of the
<a id="p306" class="xxpn">[p306]</a> lamentations which the Socialists found upon the exclusive consideration
of centrifugal Competition, if I may be allowed the
expression. They forget to take into account centripetal Competition;
and that is sufficient to reduce their doctrines to puerile
declamation. They forget that the workman, when he presents
himself in the market with the wages he has earned, becomes
a centre towards which innumerable branches of industry tend,
and that he profits then by that universal Competition of which
all trades complain in their turn.</p>

<p>It is true that the labourer, when he regards himself as a producer,
as the person who supplies labour or services, complains
also of Competition. Grant, then, that Competition benefits him
on one side, while it pinches him on the other, the question
comes to be, Is the balance favourable or unfavourable—or is
there compensation?</p>

<p>I must have explained myself very obscurely if the reader does
not see that in the play of this marvellous mechanism, the action
of Competition, apparently antagonistic, tends to the singular and
consoling result, that there is a balance which is favourable to all
at the same time; caused by gratuitous Utility continually enlarging
the circle of production, and falling continually into the domain
of Community. Now, that which becomes common is profitable
to all without hurting any one; we may even say—for this is
mathematically certain—is profitable to each in proportion to his
previous poverty. It is this portion of <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em> utility, forced
by Competition to become <em class="e000I2">common</em>, which causes the tendency of
value to become proportioned to labour, to the evident benefit of
the labourer. This, too, renders evident the social solution which
I have pressed so much on the attention of the reader, and which
is only concealed by the illusions of habit,—for a determinate
amount of labour each receives an amount of satisfactions which
tends to be increased and equalized.</p>

<p>Moreover, the condition of the labourer does not depend upon
one economic law, but upon all. To become acquainted with that
condition, to discover the prospects and the future of the labourer,
this is Political Economy; for what other object could that science
have in view?&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. But I am wrong—we have still spoliators.
What causes the equivalence of services? Liberty. What impairs
that equivalence? Oppression. Such is the circle we have still to
traverse.</p>

<p>As regards the condition of that class of labourers who execute
the more immediate work of production, it cannot be appreciated
until we are in a situation to discover in what manner the law of
<a id="p307" class="xxpn">[p307]</a> Competition is combined with that of Wages and Population, and
also with the disturbing effects of unequal taxes and monopolies.</p>

<p>I shall add but a few words on the subject of Competition. It
is very clear that it has no natural tendency to diminish the
amount of the enjoyments which are distributed over society.
Does Competition tend to make this distribution unequal? If
there be anything evident in the world, it is that after having, if I
may so express myself, attached to each service, to each value, a
larger proportion of utility, Competition labours incessantly to
level the services themselves, to render them proportional to
efforts. Is Competition not the spur which urges men into profitable
branches of industry, and urges them out of those which
are unprofitable? Its proper action, then, is to realize equality
more and more, by elevating the social level.</p>

<p>Let us not misunderstand each other, however, on this word
equality. It does not imply that all men are to have the same
remuneration, but that they are to have a remuneration proportioned
to the quantity, and even to the quality of their efforts.</p>

<p>A multitude of circumstances contribute to render the remuneration
of labour unequal (I speak here only of free labour, subject
to Competition); but if we look at it more narrowly, we shall find
that this fancied inequality, almost always just and necessary, is
in reality nothing else than substantial equality.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Cæteris paribus</em>, there are larger profits in those trades which
are attended with danger than in those which are not so; in those
which require a lengthened apprenticeship, and expensive training
long unremunerated—which imply the patient exercise of certain
domestic virtues—than in those where mere muscular exertion is
sufficient; in professions which demand a cultivated mind and refined
taste, than in trades which require mere brute force. Is not
all this just? Now, <em class="e000I2">Competition</em> establishes necessarily these distinctions—and
society has no need of the assistance of Fourier or
Louis Blanc in the matter.</p>

<p>Of all these circumstances, that which operates in the greatest
number of cases is the inequality of instruction. Now here, as
everywhere else, we find Competition exerting its twofold action,
levelling classes, and elevating society.</p>

<p>If we suppose society to be composed of two layers or strata,
placed one above another, in one of which the intelligent principle
prevails, and in the other the principle of brute force; and if we
study the natural relations of these two layers, we shall easily discover
a force of attraction in the one, and a force of aspiration in
the other, which co-operate towards their fusion. The very inequality
<a id="p308" class="xxpn">[p308]</a> of profits breathes into the inferior ranks an inextinguishable
ardour to mount to the region of ease and leisure; and this
ardour is seconded by the superior knowledge which distinguishes
the higher classes. The methods of teaching are improved; books
fall in price; instruction is acquired in less time, and at a smaller
cost; science, formerly monopolized by a class or a caste, and
veiled in a dead language, or sealed up in hieroglyphics, is written
and printed in the vulgar tongue; it pervades the atmosphere, if
I may use the expression, and is breathed as freely as the air of
heaven.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. At the same time that an education more universal
and more equal brings the two classes of society into closer
approximation, some very important economic phenomena, which
are connected with the great law of Competition, come to aid
and accelerate their fusion. The progress of the mechanical arts
diminishes continually the proportion of manual labour. The
division of labour, by simplifying and separating each of the
operations which concur in a productive result, brings within the
reach of all, branches of industry which could formerly be engaged
in only by a few. Moreover, a great many employments which
required at the outset much knowledge and varied acquirements,
fall, by the mere lapse of time, into <em class="e000I2">routine</em>, and come within the
sphere of action of classes generally the least instructed, as has
happened in the case of agriculture. Agricultural processes,
which in ancient times procured to their discoverers the honours
of an apotheosis, are now inherited and almost monopolized by
the rudest of men; and to such a degree, that this important
branch of human industry is, so to speak, entirely withdrawn from
the <em class="e000I2">well-educated</em> classes.</p>

<p>From the preceding observations it is possible that a false conclusion
may be drawn. It may be said—“We perceive, indeed,
that Competition lowers remuneration in all countries, in all departments
of industry, in all ranks, and levels, <em class="e000I2">by reducing</em>, it;
but in that case the wages of unskilled labour, of physical exertion,
must become the type, the standard, of all remuneration.”</p>

<p>I must have been misunderstood, if you have not perceived that
<em class="e000I2">Competition</em>, which labours to bring down all excessive remuneration
towards an average more and more uniform, raises <em class="e000I2">necessarily</em>
this average. I grant that it pinches men in their capacity
of producers, but in so doing it ameliorates the condition of the
human race in the only way in which it can reasonably be elevated,
namely, by an increase of material prosperity, ease, leisure, moral
and intellectual improvement, in a word, by enlarging <em class="e000I2">consumption</em>. <a id="p309" class="xxpn">[p309]</a></p>

<p>Will it be said that, in point of fact, mankind have not made
the progress that this theory seems to imply?</p>

<p>I answer, in the first place, that in modern society Competition
is far from occupying the sphere of its natural action. Our laws
run counter to it, at least in as great a degree as they favour its
action; and when it is asked whether the inequality of conditions
is owing to its presence or its absence, it is sufficient to look at the
men who make the greatest figure among us, and dazzle us by the
display of their scandalous wealth, in order to assure ourselves that
inequality, so far as it is artificial and unjust, has for foundation
conquests, monopolies, restrictions, privileged offices, functions,
and places, ministerial trafficking, public borrowing,—all things
with which Competition has nothing to do.</p>

<p>Moreover, I believe we have overlooked the real progress which
mankind have made since the very recent epoch to which we must
assign the partial enfranchisement of labour. It has been justly
said that much philosophy is needed in order to discern facts
which are continually passing before us. We are not astonished
at what an honest and laborious family of the working class daily
consumes, because habit has made us familiar with this strange
phenomenon. If, however, we compare the comfortable circumstances
in which such a family finds itself, with the condition in
which it would be placed under a social order which excluded
Competition—if statisticians, armed with an instrument of sufficient
precision, could measure, as with a dynamometer, the relation
of a working man’s labour to his enjoyments at two different
periods, we should acknowledge that liberty, restrained as it still
is, has accomplished in his favour a prodigy which its very permanency
hinders us from remarking. The contingent of human
efforts which, in relation to a given result, has been annihilated,
is truly incalculable. Time was when the artisan’s day’s labour
would not have sufficed to procure him the most trumpery
almanac. At the present day, for a halfpenny, or the fiftieth
part of his day’s wages, he can obtain a gazette containing the
matter of a volume. The same might be said of clothing, locomotion,
carriage, lighting, and a multitude of other satisfactions.
To what is this result owing? To this, that an enormous proportion
of human labour, which had formerly to be paid for, has been
handed over to be performed by the gratuitous forces of nature.
It is a value annihilated, and to be no longer recompensed.
Under the action of Competition, it has been replaced by common
and gratuitous utility. And it is worthy of remark, that when, in
consequence of progress, the price of any commodity comes to fall,
<a id="p310" class="xxpn">[p310]</a> the labour <em class="e000I2">saved</em> to the poor purchaser in obtaining it is always
<em class="e000I2">proportionally</em> greater than the labour saved to the rich purchaser.
That is demonstrable.</p>

<p>In fine, this constantly increasing current of utilities which
labour pours into all the veins of the body politic, and which Competition
distributes, is not all summed up in an accession of wealth.
It is absorbed, in great part, by the stream of advancing numbers.
It resolves itself into an increase of population, according to laws
which have an intimate affinity with the subject which now
engages us, and which will be explained in another chapter.</p>

<p>Let us now stop for a moment and take a rapid glance at the
ground over which we have just travelled.</p>

<p>Man has wants which are unlimited—desires which are insatiable.
In order to provide for them he has materials and agents
which are furnished to him by nature—faculties, instruments, all
things which <em class="e000I2">labour</em> sets in motion. Labour is the resource which
has been most equally distributed to all. Each man seeks instinctively,
and of necessity, to avail himself to the utmost of the
co-operation of natural forces, of talents natural and acquired, and
of capital, in order that the result of this co-operation may be a
greater amount of utilities produced, or, what comes to the same
thing, a greater amount of satisfactions acquired. Thus, the more
active co-operation of natural agents, the indefinite development
of intelligence, the progressive increase of capital, give rise to
this phenomenon (which at first sight seems strange)—that a given
quantity of labour furnishes an always increasing amount of utilities,
and that each man can, without despoiling anyone, obtain
a mass of consumable commodities out of all proportion to what
his own efforts could have realized.</p>

<p>But this phenomenon, which is the result of the divine harmony
which Providence has established in the mechanism of society,
would have been detrimental to society, by introducing the germ
of indefinite inequality, had there not been combined with it a
harmony no less admirable, namely, Competition, which is one of
the branches of the great law of human <em class="e000I2">solidarity</em>.</p>

<p>In fact, were it possible for an individual, a family, a class, a
nation, possessed of certain natural advantages, of an important
discovery in manufactures, or of the instruments of production in
the shape of accumulated capital, to be set permanently free from
the law of Competition, it is evident that this individual, this
family, this nation, would have for ever the monopoly of an exceptionally
high remuneration, at the expense of mankind at large.
In what situation should we be if the inhabitants of the tropical
<a id="p311" class="xxpn">[p311]</a> regions, set free from all rivalry with each other, could exact from
us, in exchange for their sugar, their coffee, their cotton, their
spices, not the equivalent of labour equal to their own, but an
amount of labour equal to what we must ourselves undergo in
order to produce these commodities under our inclement skies?
What an incalculable distance would separate the various conditions
of men, if the race of Cadmus alone could read, if the direct
descendants of Triptolemus alone could handle the plough, if
printing were confined to the family of Gutenberg, cotton-spinning
to the children of Arkwright, and if the posterity of Watt could
alone work the steam engine! Providence has not ordered things
thus, but, on the contrary, has placed in the social machine a spring
whose power is only less surprising than its simplicity—a spring
by the operation of which all productive power, all superiority in
manufacturing processes, in a word, all exclusive advantages, slip
from the hands of the producer, having remained there, in the
shape of exceptional remuneration, only long enough to excite his
zeal, and come at length to enlarge the common and gratuitous
patrimony of mankind, and resolve themselves into individual
enjoyments always progressive, and more and more equally distributed—this
spring is <em class="e000I2">Competition</em>. We have already seen its
economical effects—and it now remains for us to take a rapid
survey of its moral and political consequences. I shall confine
myself to the more important of these.</p>

<p>Superficial thinkers have accused Competition of introducing
<em class="e000I2">antagonism</em> among men. This is true and inevitable, if we consider
men only in the capacity of producers, but, regarded from another
point of view, as consumers, the matter appears in a very different
light. You then see this very Competition binding together
individuals, families, classes, nations, and races, in the bonds of
universal fraternity.</p>

<p>Seeing that the advantages which appear at first to be the property
of certain individuals become, by an admirable law of Divine
beneficence, the common patrimony of all; seeing that the <em class="e000I2">natural
advantages</em> of situation, of fertility, of temperature, of mineral
riches, and even of manufacturing aptitude, slip in a short time
from the hands of producers, by reason of their competition with
each other, and turn exclusively to the profit of consumers, it
follows that there is no country which is not interested in the
advancement and prosperity of all other countries. Every step
of progress made in the East is wealth in perspective for the
West. Fuel discovered in the South warms the men of the
North. Great Britain makes progress in her spinning mills;
<a id="p312" class="xxpn">[p312]</a> but her capitalists do not alone reap the profit, for the interest
of money does not rise; nor do her operatives, for the wages
of labour remain the same. In the long-run, it is the Russian,
the Frenchman, the Spaniard; in a word, it is the human race,
who obtain equal satisfactions at a less expense of labour, or,
what comes to the same thing, superior satisfactions with equal
labour.</p>

<p>I have spoken only of the advantages—I might say as much of
the disadvantages—which affect certain nations and certain regions.
The peculiar action of Competition is to render general what was
before exclusive. It acts exactly on the principle of <em class="e000I2">Insurance</em>. A
scourge visits the fields of the agriculturist, and the consumers of
the bread are the sufferers. An unjust tax is laid upon the vines
of France, and this means dear <em class="e000I2">wine</em> for all wine-drinkers. Thus,
advantages and disadvantages, which have any permanence, only
glance upon individuals, classes, or nations. Their providential
destination in the long-run is to affect humanity at large, and
elevate or lower the condition of mankind. Hence to envy a
certain people the fertility of their soil, or the beauty of their harbours
and rivers, or the warmth of their sun, is to overlook the
advantages in which we are called to participate. It is to contemn
the abundance which is offered to us. It is to regret the labour
which is saved to us. Hence national jealousies are not only
perverse feelings;—they are absurd. To hurt others is to injure
ourselves. To place obstacles in the way of others—tariffs, wars,
or workmen’s strikes—is to obstruct our own progress. Hence bad
passions have their chastisement, just as generous sentiments have
their reward. The inevitable sanction of an exact distributive
justice addresses itself to men’s interests, enlightens opinion, proclaims
and establishes among men these maxims of eternal truth:
that the useful is one of the aspects of the just; that Liberty is
the fairest of social Harmonies; and that Honesty is the best
Policy.</p>

<p>Christianity has introduced into the world the grand principle
of human fraternity. It addresses itself to our hearts, our feelings,
our noble instincts. Political Economy recommends the same
principle to our cool judgment; and, exhibiting the connexion of
effects with their causes, reconciles in consoling harmony the
vigilant calculations of interest with the inspirations of the sublimest
morality.</p>

<p>A second consequence which flows from this doctrine is, that
society is truly a <em class="e000I2">Community</em>. Messieurs Owen and Cabet may
save themselves the trouble of seeking the solution of the great
<a id="p313" class="xxpn">[p313]</a> <em class="e000I2">Communist</em> problem—it is found already—it results not from their
arbitrary combinations, but from the organization given by God
to man, and to society. Natural forces, expeditive processes,
instruments of production, everything is <em class="e000I2">common</em> among men, or
has a tendency to become so, everything <em class="e000I2">except pains</em>, labour, individual
effort. There is, and there can be, but one <em class="e000I2">inequality</em>—an
inequality which Communists the most absolute must admit,—that
which results from the inequality of efforts. These efforts
are what are exchanged for one another at a price bargained for.
All the utility which nature, and the genius of ages, and human
foresight, have implanted in the commodities exchanged, we obtain
<em class="e000I2">into the bargain</em>. Reciprocal remunerations have reference only
to reciprocal efforts, whether actual under the name of Labour, or
preparatory under the name of Capital. Here then is Community
in the strictest sense of the word, unless we are to pretend that
the personal share of enjoyment should be equal, although the
quota of labour furnished is not so, which indeed would be the
most iniquitous, the most monstrous, of inequalities,—I will add,
the most fatal; for it would not destroy Competition—it would
only give it a retrograde action. We should still compete, but
the Competition would be a rivalry of idleness, stupidity, and
improvidence.</p>

<p>In fine, the doctrine—so simple, and, as we think, so true—which
we have just developed, takes the great principle of human
<em class="e000I2">perfectibility</em> out of the domain of declamation, and transfers it to
that of rigorous demonstration. This internal motive, which is
never at rest in the bosom of the individual, but stirs him up to
improve his condition, gives rise to the progress of art, which is
nothing else than the progressive co-operation of forces, which
from their nature call for no remuneration. To Competition is
owing the concession to the community of advantages at first individually
obtained. The intensity of the labour required for the
production of each given result goes on continually diminishing,
to the advantage of the human race, which thus sees the circle of
its enjoyments and its leisure enlarging from one generation to
another, whilst the level of its physical, intellectual, and moral
improvement is raised; and by this arrangement, so worthy of
our study and of our profound admiration, we behold mankind
recovering the position they had lost.</p>

<p>Let me not be misunderstood, however. I do not say that all
fraternity, all community, all perfectibility, are comprised and included
in Competition. I say only that Competition is allied and
combined with these three great social dogmas—that it forms part
<a id="p314" class="xxpn">[p314]</a> of them, that it exhibits them, that it is one of the most powerful
agents of their realization.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to describe the general effects of Competition,
and consequently its benefits, for it would be impious to
suppose that any great law of nature should be at once hurtful
and permanent; but I am far from denying that the action of
Competition is accompanied with many hardships and sufferings.
It appears to me that the theory which has just been developed
explains at once those sufferings, and the inevitable complaints to
which they give rise. Since the work of Competition consists in
<em class="e000I2">levelling</em>, it must necessarily run counter to all who proudly attempt
to rise above the general level. Each producer, in order to obtain
the highest price for his labour, endeavours, as we have seen, to
retain as long as possible the exclusive use of an <em class="e000I2">agent</em>, a <em class="e000I2">process</em>, or
an <em class="e000I2">instrument</em>, of production. Now the proper mission and result
of Competition being to withdraw this exclusive use from the individual,
in order to make it <em class="e000I2">common</em> property, it is natural that
all men, in their capacity of producers, should unite in a concert
of maledictions against <em class="e000I2">Competition</em>. They cannot reconcile themselves
to Competition otherwise than by taking into account their
interests as consumers, and regarding themselves, not as members
of a coterie or a corporation, but as men.</p>

<p>Political Economy, we must say, has not yet exerted herself
sufficiently to dissipate this fatal illusion, which has been the
source of so much heartburning, calamity, and irritation, and of
so many wars. This science, from a preference not very philosophical,
has exhausted her efforts in analyzing the phenomena of
production. The very nomenclature of the science, in fact, convenient
as it is, is not in harmony with its object. Agriculture,
manufactures, commerce, may be an excellent classification, when
the object is to describe the <em class="e000I2">processes</em> of art; but that description,
however essential in technology, has little connexion with social
economy;—I should even say that it is positively dangerous.
When we have classed men as agriculturists, manufacturers, and
merchants, of what can we speak but of their class interests, of
those special interests to which Competition is antagonistic, and
which are placed in opposition to the general good? It is not for
the sake of agriculturists that agriculture exists, of manufacturers
that we have manufactures, or of merchants that we have exchanges,
but in order that men should have at their disposal the
greatest amount of commodities of every kind. <em class="e000I2">Consumption</em>, its
laws, what favours it, and renders it equitable and moral—that is
the interest which is truly social, and which truly affects the human
<a id="p315" class="xxpn">[p315]</a> race. It is the interest of the consumer which constitutes the real
object of Political Economy, and upon which the science should
concentrate its clearest lights. This, in truth, forms the bond
which unites classes, nations, races—it is the principle and explanation
of human fraternity. It is with regret, then, that we see
Economists expending their talents and sagacity on the anatomy
of production, and throwing into the fag-end of their books, or into
supplementary chapters, a few common-places on the phenomena
of consumption. Have we not even seen a justly celebrated professor
suppressing entirely that branch of the science, confining
himself to the <em class="e000I2">means</em>, without ever speaking of the <em class="e000I2">result</em>, and
banishing from his course everything in connexion with the <em class="e000I2">consumption
of wealth</em>, as pertaining, in his opinion, to morals rather
than to Political Economy? Can we be surprised that men are
more struck with the inconveniences of Competition than with its
advantages, since the former affect them specially as producers,—in
which character they are constantly considered and talked of;
while the latter affect them only in their capacity of consumers,—a
capacity which is altogether disregarded and overlooked?</p>

<p>I repeat that I do not deny or ignore, on the contrary I deplore
as much as any one can, the sufferings attendant on Competition;
but is this any reason for shutting our eyes to its advantages?
And it is all the more consoling to observe these advantages, inasmuch
as I believe Competition, like all the great laws of nature,
to be indestructible. Had it been otherwise, it would assuredly
have succumbed to the universal resistance which all the men who
have ever co-operated in the production of commodities since the
beginning of the world have offered to it, and more especially it
would have perished under the <em class="e000I2">levée en masse</em> of our modern reformers.
But if they have been foolish enough to attempt its
destruction, they have not been strong enough to effect it.</p>

<p>And what progressive principle, I would ask, is to be found in
the world, the beneficent action of which is not mingled, especially
in the beginning, with suffering and misery? The massing together
of human beings in vast agglomerations is favourable to
boldness and independence of thought, but it frequently sets
private life free from the wholesome restraint of public opinion,
and gives shelter to debauchery and crime. Wealth and leisure
united give birth to mental cultivation, but they also give birth to
pride and luxury among the rich, and to irritation and covetousness
among the poor. The art of printing brings home knowledge
and truth to all ranks of society, but it has brought also
afflicting doubt and subversive error. Political liberty has unchained
<a id="p316" class="xxpn">[p316]</a> tempests and revolutions, and has modified the simple
manners of primitive nations, to such a decree as to induce thinking
men to ask themselves whether they would not have preferred
tranquillity under the cold shade of despotism. Christianity herself
has cast the noble seed of love and charity into a soil saturated
with the blood of martyrs.</p>

<p>Why has it entered into the designs of Infinite Goodness and
Justice that the happiness of one region or of one era should be
purchased at the expense of the sufferings of another region or of
another era? What is the Divine purpose which is concealed
under this great law of <em class="e000I2">solidarity</em>, of which Competition is only
one of the mysterious aspects? Human science cannot answer.
What we do know is this, that good always goes on increasing,
and that evil goes on diminishing. From the beginning of the
social state, such as conquest had made it, when there existed only
masters and slaves, and the inequality of conditions was extreme,
the work of Competition in approximating ranks, fortunes, intelligences,
could not be accomplished without inflicting individual
hardships, the intensity of which, however, as the work proceeded,
has gone on diminishing, like the vibrations of sound and the
oscillations of the pendulum. To the sufferings yet in reserve for
them, men learn every day to oppose two powerful remedies—namely,
<em class="e000I2">foresight</em>, which is the fruit of knowledge and experience;
and <em class="e000I2">association</em>, which is organized foresight.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>In the first part of this work—alas! too hastily written—I have
endeavoured to keep the reader’s attention fixed upon the line of
demarcation, always flexible, but always marked, which separates
the two regions of the economic world—natural co-operation, and
human labour—the bounty of God, and the work of man—the
gratuitous, and the onerous—that which in exchange is remunerated,
and that which is transferred without remuneration—aggregate
utility, and the fractional and supplementary utility which
constitutes value—absolute wealth, and relative wealth—the co-operation
of chemical or mechanical forces, constrained to aid
production by the instruments which render them available, and
the just recompense of the labour which has created these instruments
themselves—Community and Property.</p>

<p>It is not enough to mark these two orders of phenomena which
are so essentially different, it is necessary also to describe their
relations, and, if I may so express myself, their harmonious evolutions.
I have essayed to explain how the business of Property
consists in conquering utility for the human race, and, casting it
<a id="p317" class="xxpn">[p317]</a> into the domain of Community, to move on to new conquests—so
that each given effort, and consequently the aggregate of efforts,
should continually be delivering over to mankind satisfactions
which are always increasing. Human services exchanged, while
preserving their relative value, become the vehicle of an always
increasing proportion of utility which is gratuitous, and, therefore,
common; and in this consists progress. The possessors of value,
then, whatever form it assumes, far from usurping and monopolizing
the gifts of God, multiply these gifts, without causing them to
lose the character which Providence has affixed to them, of being—Gratuitous.</p>

<p>In proportion as the satisfactions which are handed over by
progress to the charge of nature fall by that very fact into the
domain of Community, they become <em class="e000I2">equal</em>—it being impossible for
us even to conceive inequality except in the domain of human services,
which are compared, appreciated, and <em class="e000I2">estimated</em> with a view
to an exchange; whence it follows that Equality among men is
necessarily progressive. It is so, likewise, in another respect, the
action of Competition having for its inevitable result to level and
equalize the services themselves, and to bring their recompense
more and more into proportion with their merit.</p>

<p>Let us now throw a glance back on the ground over which we
have passed.</p>

<p>By the light of the theory, the foundation of which has been laid
in the present volume, we shall have to investigate:</p>

<p>The relations of man with the Economic phenomena, in his
capacity of producer, and in his character of consumer;</p>

<p>The law of Rent;</p>

<p>That of Wages;</p>

<p>That of Credit;</p>

<p>That of Taxation, which, introducing us into the domain of
Politics, properly so called, will lead us to compare those services
which are private and voluntary with those which are public
and compulsory;</p>

<p>The law of Population.</p>

<p>We shall then be in a situation to solve some practical problems
which are still disputed—Free-trade, Machinery, Luxury, Leisure,
Association, Organization of Labour, etc.</p>

<p>I hesitate not to say, that the result of this exposition may be
expressed beforehand in these terms: <em class="e000I2">The constant approximation
of all men towards a level which is always rising</em>—in other terms:
<em class="e000I2">Improvement and Equalization</em>; in a single word, <em class="e00S02">Harmony</em>.</p>

<p>Such is the definitive result of the arrangements of Providence—of
<a id="p318" class="xxpn">[p318]</a> the great laws of nature—when they act without impediment,
when we regard them as they are in themselves, and apart from any
disturbance of their action by error and violence. On beholding
this Harmony, the Economist may well exclaim, like the astronomer
who regards the planetary movements, or the physiologist
who contemplates the structure and arrangement of the human
organs—<em class="e000I2">Digitus Dei est hic!</em></p>

<p>But man is a free agent, and consequently fallible. He is subject
to ignorance and to passion. His will, which is liable to err,
enters as an element into the play of the economic laws. He may
misunderstand them, forget them, divert them from their purpose.
As the physiologist, after admiring the infinite wisdom displayed
in the structure and relations of our organs and viscera, studies
these organs likewise in their abnormal state when sickly and diseased,
we shall have to penetrate into a new world—the world of
social Disturbances.</p>

<p>We shall pave the way for this new study by some considerations
on man himself. It would be impossible for us to give an
account of <em class="e000I2">social evil</em>, of its origin, its effects, its design—of the
limits, always more and more contracted, within which it is shut
up by its own action (which constitutes what I might almost
venture to call a harmonic dissonance), did we not extend our
investigation to the necessary consequences of Free-Will, to the
errors of Self-Interest, which are constantly corrected, and to the
great laws of human Responsibility and Solidarity.</p>

<p>We have seen the germ of all the <em class="e000I2">social Harmonies</em> included in
these two principles—<em class="e00S02">Property</em>, <em class="e00S02">Liberty</em>. We shall see that all
<em class="e000I2">social Dissonances</em> are only the development of these two antagonistic
principles—<em class="e00S02">Spoliation</em>, <em class="e00S02">Oppression</em>.</p>

<p>The words Property and Liberty, in fact, express only two aspects
of the same idea. In an economical point of view, Liberty
is allied to the act of production—Property to the things produced.
And since Value has its foundation in the human act, we
may conclude that Liberty implies and includes Property. The
same relation exists between Oppression and Spoliation.</p>

<p>Liberty! here at length we have the principle of harmony. Oppression!
here we have the principle of dissonance. The struggle
of these two powers fills the annals of the human race.</p>

<p>And as the design of Oppression is to effect an unjust appropriation,
as it resolves itself into and is summed up in spoliation, it is
Spoliation that must form the subject of our inquiry.</p>

<p>Man comes into this world bound to the yoke of Want, which
is pain. <a id="p319" class="xxpn">[p319]</a></p>

<p>He cannot escape from it but by subjecting himself to the yoke
of Labour, which is pain also.</p>

<p>He has, then, only a choice of pains, and he detests pain.</p>

<p>This is the reason why he looks around him, and if he sees that
his fellow-man has accumulated wealth, he conceives the thought
of appropriating it. Hence comes false property, or Spoliation.</p>

<p>Spoliation! here we have a new element in the economy of
society.</p>

<p>From the day when it first made its appearance in the world
down to the day when it shall have completely disappeared, if
that day ever come, this element has affected and will affect profoundly
the whole social mechanism; it will disturb, and to the
extent of rendering them no longer recognisable, those laws of
social harmony which we have endeavoured to discover and describe.</p>

<p>Our duty, then, will not have been accomplished until we have
completed the monography of Spoliation.</p>

<p>It may be imagined that we have here to do with an accidental
and exceptional fact, a transient derangement unworthy of the investigations
of science.</p>

<p>But in truth it is not so. On the contrary, Spoliation, in the
traditions of families, in the history of nations, in the occupations
of individuals, in the physical and intellectual energies of classes,
in the schemes and designs of governments, occupies nearly as
prominent a place as Property itself.</p>

<p>No; Spoliation is not an ephemeral scourge, affecting accidentally
the social mechanism, and which economical science may
disregard as exceptional.</p>

<p>The sentence pronounced upon man in the beginning was, <em class="e000I2">In the
sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread</em>. Whence it appears that
effort and satisfaction are indissolubly united, and that the one
must be always the recompense of the other. But on all sides
we find man revolting against this law, and saying to his brother,
Thine be the labour, and mine the fruit of that labour.</p>

<p>Repair to the hut of the savage hunter, or to the tent of the
nomad shepherd, and what spectacle meets your eyes? The wife,
lank, pale, disfigured, affrighted, prematurely old, bears the whole
burden of the household cares, while the man lounges in idleness.
What idea can we form of family Harmonies? The idea has disappeared,
for Strength here throws upon Feebleness the weight of
labour. And how many ages of civilizing effort will be needed to
raise the wife from this state of frightful degradation?</p>

<p>Spoliation, in its most brutal form, armed with torch and sword,
<a id="p320" class="xxpn">[p320]</a> fills the annals of the world. Of what names is history made up?
Cyrus, Sesostris, Alexander, Scipio, Cæsar, Attila, Tamerlane,
Mahomet, Pizarro, William the Conqueror—pure Spoliation from
beginning to end in the shape of Conquest. Hers are the laurels,
the monuments, the statues, the triumphal arches, the song of the
poet, the intoxicating enthusiasm of the fair!</p>

<p>The Conqueror soon finds that he can turn his victories to more
profitable account than by putting to death the vanquished; and
Slavery covers the earth. Down to our own times, all over the
world this has been the form in which societies have existed,
bringing with it hates, resistance, internal struggles, and revolutions.
And what is Slavery but organized oppression—organized
for the purpose of Spoliation?</p>

<p>But Spoliation not only arms Force against Feebleness—she
turns Intelligence against Credulity. What hard-working people
in the world has escaped being sweated by sacerdotal theocracies,
Egyptian priests, Greek oracles, Roman auguries, Gallic druids,
Indian brahmins, muftis, ulemas, bonzes, monks, ministers, mountebanks,
sorcerers, soothsayers,—spoliators of all garbs and of all
denominations. Assuming this guise, Spoliation places the fulcrum
of her lever in heaven, and sacrilegiously prides herself on
the complicity of the gods! She enslaves not men’s limbs only,
but their souls. She knows how to impress the iron of slavery
as well upon the conscience of Séide<a
href="#FN_65" id="FNa_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> as upon the forehead
of Spartacus—realizing what would seem impossible—Mental
Slavery.</p>

<p>Mental Slavery! what a frightful association of words! O
Liberty! we have seen thee hunted from country to country,
crushed by conquest, groaning under slavery, insulted in courts,
banished from the schools, laughed at in saloons, misunderstood
in workshops, denounced in churches. It seems thou shouldst
find in thought an inviolable refuge. But if thou art to surrender
in this thy last asylum, what becomes of the hopes of ages, and of
what value is human existence?</p>

<p>At length, however, the progressive nature of man causes Spoliation
to develop in the society in which it exists, resistance which
paralyzes its force, and knowledge which unveils its impostures.
But Spoliation does not confess herself conquered for all that; she
only becomes more crafty, and, enveloping herself in the forms of
government and in a system of checks and counterpoises, she
gives birth to Politics, long a prolific resource. We then see her
usurping the liberty of citizens, the better to get hold of their wealth,
<a id="p321" class="xxpn">[p321]</a> and draining away their wealth to possess herself more surely of
their liberty. Private activity passes into the domain of public
activity. Everything is transacted through functionaries, and
an unintelligent and meddling bureaucracy overspreads the land.
The public treasury becomes a vast reservoir into which labourers
pour their savings, to be immediately distributed among placemen.
Transactions are no longer regulated by free bargaining and discussion,
and the <em class="e000I2">mutuality of services</em> disappears.</p>

<p>In this state of things the true notion of Property is extinguished,
and every one appeals to the Law to give his services
a factitious value.</p>

<p>We enter then upon the era of privileges. Spoliation, ever
improving in subtilty, fortifies herself in Monopoly, and takes
refuge behind Restrictions. She displaces the natural current of
exchanges, and sends capital into artificial channels, and with
capital, labour—and with labour, population. She gets painfully
produced in the North what is produced with facility in the South;
creates precarious classes and branches of industry; substitutes
for the gratuitous forces of nature the onerous fatigues of labour;
cherishes establishments which can sustain no rivalry, and invokes
against competitors the employment of force; provokes international
jealousies; flatters patriotic arrogance; and invents ingenious
theories, which make auxiliaries of her own dupes. She
constantly renders imminent industrial crises and bankruptcies,
shakes to its foundation all confidence in the future, all faith in
liberty, all consciousness of what is just. At length, when science
exposes her misdeeds, she stirs up against science her own victims,
by proclaiming a Utopia! and ignores not only the science which
places obstacles in her path, but the very idea of any possible
science, by this crowning sentence of scepticism—There are no
principles!</p>

<p>Under the pressure of suffering, at length the masses rise, and
overturn everything which is above them. Government, taxes,
legislation, everything is at their mercy, and you imagine perhaps
that there is now an end to the reign of Spoliation;—that the
mutuality of services is about to be established on the only possible
or even imaginable basis—Liberty. Undeceive yourself. The
fatal idea, alas! has permeated the masses, that Property has no
other origin, no other sanction, no other legitimacy, no other foundation,
than Law; and then the masses set to work legislatively
to rob one another. Suffering from the wounds which have been
inflicted upon them, they undertake to cure each of their members
by conceding to him the right to oppress his neighbour, and call
<a id="p322" class="xxpn">[p322]</a> this Solidarity and Fraternity. “You have produced—I have not
produced—we are <em class="e000I2">solidaires</em>—let us divide.” “You have something—I
have nothing—we are brethren—let us share.” It will be
our duty then to examine the improper use which has been made
in these latter days of the terms association, organization, labour,
<em class="e000I2">gratuité du crédit</em>, etc. We shall have to subject them to this test—Do
they imply Liberty or Oppression? In other words, are they
in unison with the great Economical laws, or are they disturbances
of those laws?</p>

<p>Spoliation is a phenomenon too universal, too persistent, to
permit us to attribute to it a character purely accidental. In this,
as in many other matters, we cannot separate the study of natural
laws from the study of their Perturbations.</p>

<p>But, it may be said, if spoliation enters necessarily into the play
of the social mechanism as a <em class="e000I2">dissonance</em>, how can you venture to
assert the Harmony of the Economic laws?</p>

<p>I must repeat here what I have said in another place, namely,
that in all which concerns man, a being who is only <em class="e000I2">perfectible</em>
because he is <em class="e000I2">imperfect</em>, Harmony consists, not in the absolute
absence of <em class="e000I2">evil</em>, but in its gradual diminution. The social body,
like the human body, is provided with a curative force, a <em class="e000I2">vis medicatrix</em>,
the laws and infallible power of which it is impossible to
study without again exclaiming, <em class="e000I2">Digitus Dei est hic</em>. <a id="p323" class="xxpn">[p323]</a></p>

PRODUCER—CONSUMER.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
If the level of the human race is not continually rising, man is not
a perfectible being.</p>

<p>If the social tendency is not a constant approximation of all
men towards this progressive elevation, the economic laws are not
harmonious.</p>

<p>Now, how can the level of humanity be rising, if each given
quantity of labour does not yield a constantly increasing amount
of enjoyments, a phenomenon which can be explained only by the
transformation of onerous into gratuitous utility.</p>

<p>And, on the other hand, how can this utility, having become
gratuitous, bring men nearer and nearer to a common level, if the
utility has not at the same time itself become common?</p>

<p>Here, then, we discover the essential law of social harmony.</p>

<p>I should have been pleased had the language of Political Economy
furnished me with two words other than the terms <em class="e000I2">production</em>
and <em class="e000I2">consumption</em>, to designate services which are rendered and received.
These terms savour too much of materiality. There are
evidently services, like those of the clergyman, the professor,
the soldier, the artist, which tend to the furtherance of morality,
education, security, taste, which have nothing in common with
mechanical or manufacturing industry, except this, that the end
to be attained is <em class="e000I2">satisfaction</em> or enjoyment.</p>

<p>The terms I have referred to are those generally employed, and
I have no wish to become a neologist. But let it be understood
that by <em class="e000I2">production</em> I mean what confers utility, and by <em class="e000I2">consumption</em>
the enjoyment to which that utility gives rise.</p>

<p>Let the protectionist school—which is in reality a phase of
Communism—believe that in employing the terms <em class="e000I2">producer</em> and
<em class="e000I2">consumer</em> we are not absurd enough to wish to represent the human
race as divided into two distinct classes, the one engaged <a id="p324" class="xxpn">[p324]</a> exclusively
in the work of producing, the other exclusively in that of
consuming. The naturalist divides the human race into whites
and blacks, or into men and women, and the economist, forsooth,
is not to classify them as producers and consumers, because, as
the protectionist gentlemen sagely remark, <em class="e000I2">producer and consumer
make but one person</em>!</p>

<p>Why, it is for the very reason that they do make but one that
each individual comes to be considered by the science of Political
Economy in this double capacity. Our business is not to divide
the human race into two classes, but to study man under two very
different aspects. If the protectionists were to forbid grammarians
to employ the pronouns <em class="e000I2">I</em> and <em class="e000I2">thou</em>, on the pretext that every man
is in turn <em class="e000I2">the person speaking</em> and <em class="e000I2">the person spoken to</em>, it would be
a sufficient answer to say, that although it be perfectly true that
we cannot place all the tongues on one side, and all the ears on the
other, since every man has both ears and a tongue, it by no means
follows that, with reference to each proposition enunciated, the
tongue does not pertain to one man and the ear to another. In
the same way, <em class="e000I2">with reference to every service</em>, the man who renders
it is quite distinct from the man who receives it. The producer
and consumer are always set opposite each other, so much so that
they have always a controversy.</p>

<p>The very people who object to our studying mankind under the
double aspect of producers and consumers have no difficulty in
making this distinction when they address themselves to legislative
assemblies. We then find them demanding monopoly or freedom
of trade, according as the matter in dispute refers to a commodity
which they sell, or a commodity which they purchase.</p>

<p>Without dwelling longer, then, on this preliminary exception
taken by the protectionists, let us acknowledge that in the social
order the separation of employments causes each man to occupy
two situations, sufficiently distinct to render their action and
relations worthy of our study.</p>

<p>In general, we devote ourselves to some special trade, profession,
or career, and it is not from that particular source that we expect
to derive our satisfactions. We render and receive services; we
supply and demand values; we make purchases and sales; we
work for others, and others work for us; in short, we are <em class="e000I2">producers
and consumers</em>.</p>

<p>According as we present ourselves in the market in one or other
of these capacities, we carry thither a spirit which is very different,
or rather, I should say, very opposite. Suppose, for example, that
corn is the subject of the transaction. The same man has very
<a id="p325" class="xxpn">[p325]</a> different views when he goes to market as a purchaser, from what
he has when he goes there as a seller. As a purchaser, he desires
abundance; as a seller, scarcity. In either case, these desires may
be traced to the same source—personal interest; but as to sell or
buy, to give or to receive, to supply or to demand, are acts as
opposite as possible, they cannot but give rise, and from the same
motive, to opposite desires.</p>

<p>Antagonistic desires cannot at one and the same time coincide
with the general good.</p>

<p>In another work,<a
href="#FN_66" id="FNa_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> I have endeavoured to show that the wishes
or desires of men in their capacity of consumers are those which
are in harmony with the public interest; and it cannot be otherwise.
For seeing that enjoyment is the end and design of labour,
and that the labour is determined only by the obstacle to be overcome,
it is evident that labour is in this sense an <em class="e000I2">evil</em>, and that
everything should tend to diminish it; that enjoyment is a <em class="e000I2">good</em>,
and that everything should tend to increase it.</p>

<p>And here presents itself the great, the perpetual, the deplorable
illusion which springs from the erroneous definition of <em class="e000I2">value</em>, and
from confounding value with <em class="e000I2">utility</em>.</p>

<p>Value being simply a relation, is of as much greater importance
to each individual as it is of less importance to society at large.</p>

<p>What renders service to the masses is utility alone; and value
is not at all the measure of it.</p>

<p>What renders service to the individual is still only utility. But
value is the measure of it; for, with each determinate value, he
obtains from society the utility of his choice, in the proportion of
that value.</p>

<p>If we regard man as an isolated being, it is as clear as day that
consumption, and not production, is the essential thing; for consumption
to a certain extent implies labour, but labour does not
imply consumption.</p>

<p>The separation of employments has led certain economists to
measure the general prosperity, not by consumption, but by labour.
And by following these economists we have come to this strange
subversion of principle, to favour labour at the expense of its
results.</p>

<p>The reasoning has been this: The more difficulties are overcome
the better. Then augment the difficulties to be conquered.</p>

<p>The error of this reasoning is manifest.</p>

<p>No doubt, a certain amount of difficulties being given, it is
fortunate that a certain quantity of labour also given should
<a id="p326" class="xxpn">[p326]</a> surmount as many of these difficulties as possible. But to
diminish the power of the labourer or augment that of the difficulties,
in order to increase value, is positively monstrous.</p>

<p>An individual member of society is interested in this, that his
services, while preserving even the same degree of utility, should
increase in value. Suppose his desires in this respect to be realized,
it is easy to perceive what will happen. He is better off, but his
brethren are worse off, seeing that the total amount of utility has
not been increased.</p>

<p>We cannot then reason from particulars to generals, and say:
Pursue such measures as in their result will satisfy the desire
which all individuals entertain to see the value of their services
augmented.</p>

<p>Value being a relation, we should have accomplished nothing
if the increase in all departments were proportionate to the anterior
value; if it were arbitrary and unequal for different services, we
should have done nothing but introduce injustice into the distribution
of utilities.</p>

<p>It is of the nature of every bargain or mercantile transaction to
give rise to a <em class="e000I2">debate</em>. But by using this word debate, shall I not
bring down upon myself all the sentimental schools which are
nowadays so numerous? <em class="e000I2">Debate</em> implies <em class="e000I2">antagonism</em>, it will be
said. You admit, then, that antagonism is the natural state of
society. Here again I have to break another lance; for in this
country economic science is so little understood, that one cannot
make use of a word without raising up an opponent.</p>

<p>I have been justly reproached for using the phrase that “Between
the seller and buyer there exists a radical antagonism.” The word
<em class="e000I2">antagonism</em>, when strengthened by the word <em class="e000I2">radical</em>, implies much
more than I meant to express. It would seem to imply a permanent
opposition of interests, consequently an indestructible
social dissonance; while what I wished to indicate was merely that
transient debate or discussion which precedes every commercial
transaction, and which is inherent in the very idea of a bargain.</p>

<p>As long as, to the regret of the sentimental utopiast, there shall
remain a vestige of liberty in the world, buyers and sellers will
discuss their interests, and higgle about prices; nor will the social
laws cease to be harmonious on that account. Is it possible to
conceive that the man who <em class="e000I2">offers</em> and the man who <em class="e000I2">demands</em> a
service should meet each other in the market without having for
the moment a different idea of its <em class="e000I2">value</em>? Is that to set the world
on fire? Must all commercial transactions, all exchanges, all barter,
all liberty, be banished from this earth, or are we to allow each of
<a id="p327" class="xxpn">[p327]</a> the contracting parties to defend his position, and urge and put forward
his motives? It is this very free debate or discussion which
gives rise to the equivalence of services and the equity of transactions.
By what other means can our system-makers ensure this
equity which is so desirable? Would they by legislation trammel
the liberty of one of the parties only? Then the one must be in
the power of the other. Would they take away from both the
liberty of managing their own affairs, under the pretext that they
ought henceforth to buy and sell on the principle of fraternity?
Let me tell the Socialists that it is here their absurdity becomes
apparent, for, in the long-run, these interests must be regulated and
adjusted. Is the discussion to be inverted, the purchaser taking
the part of the seller and <em class="e000I2">vice versa</em>? Such transactions would be
very diverting, we must allow. “Please, sir, give me only 10 francs
for this cloth.” “What say you? I will give you 20 for it.” “But,
my good sir, it is worth nothing—it is out of fashion—it will be worn
out in a fortnight,” says the merchant. “It is of the best quality,
and will last two winters,” replies the customer. “Very well, sir,
to please you, I will add 5 francs—this is all the length that
fraternity will allow me to go.” “It is against my Socialist principles
to pay less than 20 francs, but we must learn to make sacrifices,
and I agree.” Thus this whimsical transaction will just arrive at
the ordinary result, and our system-makers will regret to see
accursed liberty still surviving, although turned upside down and
engendering a new antagonism.</p>

<p>That is not what we want, say the <em class="e000I2">organisateurs</em>; what we
desire is liberty. Then, what would you be at? for services must
still be exchanged, and conditions adjusted. We expect that the
care of adjusting them should be left to us. I suspected as
much. . . . .&#160;.</p>

<p>Fraternity! bond of brotherhood, sacred flame kindled by heaven
in man’s soul, how has thy name been abused! In thy name all
freedom has been stifled. In thy name a new despotism, such as
the world had never before seen, has been erected; and we are at
length driven to fear that the very name of fraternity, after being
thus sullied, and having served as the rallying cry of so many
incapables, the mask of so much ambition, and proud contempt of
human dignity, should end by losing altogether its grand and noble
significance.</p>

<p>Let us no longer, then, aim at overturning everything, domineering
over everything and everybody, and withdrawing all—men
and things—from the operation of natural laws. Let us leave
the world as God has made it. Let us, poor scribblers, not imagine
<a id="p328" class="xxpn">[p328]</a> ourselves anything else than observers, more or less exact, of what
is passing around us. Let us no longer render ourselves ridiculous by
pretending to change human nature, as if we were ourselves beyond
humanity and its errors and weaknesses. Let us leave producers
and consumers to take care of their own interests, and to arrange
and adjust these interests by honest and peaceful conventions. Let
us confine ourselves to the observation of relations, and the effects
to which they give rise. This is precisely what I am about to do,
keeping always in view this general law, which I apprehend to be
the law of human society, namely, the gradual equalization of individuals
and of classes, combined with general progress.</p>

<p>A line no more resembles a force or a velocity, than it does a
value or a utility. Mathematicians, nevertheless, make use of
diagrams; and why should not the economist do the same?</p>

<p>We have values which are equal, values the mutual relations of
which are known as the half, the quarter, double, triple, etc. There
is nothing to prevent our representing these differences by lines of
various lengths.</p>

<p>But the same thing does not hold with reference to <em class="e000I2">utility</em>.
General utility, as we have seen, may be resolved into gratuitous
utility and onerous utility, the former due to the action of nature,
the latter the result of human labour. This last being capable of
being estimated and measured, may be represented by a line of
determinate length; but the other is not susceptible of estimation
or of measurement. No doubt in the production of a measure of
wheat, of a cask of wine, of an ox, of a stone of wool, a ton of
coals, a bundle of faggots, nature does much. But we have no
means of measuring this natural co-operation of forces, most of
which are unknown to us, and which have been in operation
since the beginning of time. Nor have we any interest in doing
so. We may represent gratuitous utility, then, by an indefinite
line.</p>

<p>Now, let there be two products, the <em class="e000I2">value</em> of the one being
double that of the other, they may be represented by these
lines:—</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="p328img">
<img src="images/i328.jpg" width="600" height="161" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>IB, ID, represent the total product, general utility, what
satisfies man’s wants, absolute wealth.</p>

<p>IA, IC, the co-operation of nature, gratuitous utility, the part
which belongs to the domain of community.</p>

<p>AB, CD, human service, onerous utility, <em class="e000I2">value</em>, relative wealth,
the part which belongs to the domain of property.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>I need not say that AB, which you may suppose, if you will,
to represent a house, a piece of furniture, a book, a song sung by
Jenny Lind, a horse, a bale of cloth, a consultation of physicians,
etc., will exchange for twice CD, and that the two men who effect
the exchange will give into the bargain, and without even being
aware of it, the one, once IA, the other twice IC.</p>

<p>Man is so constituted that his constant endeavour is to diminish
the proportion of effort to result, to substitute the action of nature
for his own action; in a word, to accomplish more with less.
This is the constant aim of his skill, his intelligence, and his
energy.</p>

<p>Let us suppose then that John, the producer of IB, discovers a
process by means of which he accomplishes his work with one-half
the labour which it formerly cost him, taking everything into
account, even the construction of the instrument by means of
which he avails himself of the co-operation of nature.</p>

<p>As long as he preserves his secret, we shall have no change in
the figures we have given above; AB and CD will represent the
same values, the same relations; for John alone of all the world
being acquainted with the improved process, he will turn it exclusively
to his own profit and advantage. He will take his ease for
half the day, or else he will make, each day, twice the quantity of
IB, and his labour will be better remunerated. The discovery he
has made is for the good of mankind, but mankind in this case is
represented by one man.</p>

<p>And here let us remark, in passing, how fallacious is the axiom
of the English Economists that <em class="e000I2">value comes from labour</em>, if thereby
it is intended to represent <em class="e000I2">value</em> and <em class="e000I2">labour</em> as proportionate.
Here we have the labour diminished by one-half, and yet no
change in the value. This is what constantly happens, and why?
Because the service is the same. Before as after the discovery,
as long as it is a secret, he who gives or transfers IB renders the
same service. But things will no longer be in the same position
when Peter, the producer of ID, is enabled to say, “You ask me
for two hours of my labour in exchange for one hour of yours;
but I have found out your process, and if you set so high a price
on your service, I shall serve myself.”</p>

<p>Now this day must necessarily come. A process once realized <a id="p330" class="xxpn">[p330]</a>
is not long a mystery. Then the value of the product IB will
fall by one-half, and we shall have these two figures.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="p330img">
<img src="images/i330.jpg" width="600" height="192" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>AA´ represent value annihilated, relative wealth which has
disappeared, property become common, utility formerly onerous,
now gratuitous.</p>
</div></div>

<p>For, as regards John, who here represents the producer, he is
reinstated in his former condition. With the same effort which
it cost him formerly to produce IB, he can now produce twice as
much. In order to obtain twice ID, we see him constrained to
give twice IB, or what IB represents, be it furniture, books,
houses, or what it may.</p>

<p>Who profits by all this? Clearly Peter, the producer of ID,
who here represents consumers in general, including John himself.
If, in fact, John desires to consume his own product, he profits by
the saving of time represented by the suppression of AA´. As
regards Peter, that is to say as regards consumers in general,
they can now purchase IB with half the expenditure of time,
effort, labour, value, compared with what it would have cost them
before the intervention of natural forces. These forces, then, are
gratuitous, and, moreover, common.</p>

<p>Since I have ventured to illustrate my argument by geometrical
figures, perhaps I may be permitted to give another example, and
I shall be happy if by this method—somewhat whimsical, I allow,
as applied to Political Economy—I can render more intelligible to
the reader the phenomena which I wish to describe.</p>

<p>As a producer, or as a consumer, every man may be considered
as a centre from whence radiate the services which he renders, and
to which tend the services which he receives in exchange.</p>

<p>Suppose then that there is placed at A (Fig. 1) a producer, a
copyist, for example, or transcriber of manuscripts, who here represents
all producers, or production in general. He furnishes to
society four manuscripts. If at the present moment the <em class="e000I2">value</em> of
each of these manuscripts is equal to 15, he renders services equal
to 60, and receives an equal value, variously spread over a multitude
of services. To simplify the demonstration, I suppose only
<a id="p331" class="xxpn">[p331]</a> four of them, proceeding from four points of the circumference
BCDE.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig-1_2">

<p>This man, we now suppose, discovers the art of printing. He
can thenceforth produce in 40 hours what formerly would have
cost him 60. Admit that competition forces him to reduce proportionally
the price of his books, and that in place of being
worth 15, they are now worth only 10. But then in place of four
our workman can now produce six books. On the other hand, the
fund of remuneration proceeding from the circumference, amounting
to 60, has not changed. There is remuneration for six books,
worth 10 each, just as there was formerly remuneration for four
manuscripts, each worth 15.</p>

<p>This, let me remark briefly, is what is always lost sight of in discussing
the question of machinery, of free-trade, and of progress in
general. Men see the labour set free and rendered disposable by
the expeditive process, and they become alarmed. They do not
see that a corresponding proportion of remuneration is rendered
disposable also by the same circumstance.</p>

<p>The new transactions we have supposed are represented by
Fig. 2, where we see radiate from the centre A, a total value of
60, spread over six books, in place of four manuscripts. From the
circumference still proceeds a value, equal to 60, necessary now as
formerly, to make up the balance.</p>

<p>Who then has gained by the change? As regards <em class="e000I2">value</em>, no one.
As regards real wealth, positive satisfactions, the countless body
of consumers ranged round the circumference. Each of them can
now purchase a book with an amount of labour reduced by one-third.
But the consumers are the human race. For observe that
<a id="p332" class="xxpn">[p332]</a> A himself, if he gains nothing in his capacity of producer,—if he is
obliged, as formerly, to perform 60 hours’ labour in order to obtain
the old remuneration,—nevertheless, in as far as he is a consumer
of books, gains exactly as others do. Like them, if he desires to
read, he can procure this enjoyment with an economy of labour
equal to one-third.</p>

<p>But if, in his character of producer, he finds himself at length
deprived of the profit of his own inventions, by competition, where
in that case is his compensation?</p>

<p>His compensation consists, 1<em class="e000I2">st</em>, in this, that as long as he was
able to preserve his secret, he continued to sell 15 of what he produced
at the cost of 10; 2<em class="e000I2">dly</em>, In this, that he obtains books for
his own use at a smaller cost, and thus participates in the advantages
he has procured for society. But, 3<em class="e000I2">dly</em>, His compensation
consists above all in this, that just in the same way as he has been
forced to impart to his fellow-men the benefit of his own progress,
he benefits by the progress of his fellow-men.</p>

<div class="figright">
<div class="caption"><em class="e00S02">Fig. 3.</em></div>
<img src="images/i332.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Just as the progress accomplished by A has profited B, C, D, E,
the progress realized by B, C, D, E has profited A. By turns A
finds himself at the centre and at the circumference of universal
industry, for he is by turns producer and consumer. If B, for
example, is a cotton-spinner who has introduced improved machinery,
the profit will redound to
A as well as to C, D. If C is a
mariner who has replaced the oar by
the sail, the economy of labour will
profit B, A, E.</p>

<p>In short, the whole mechanism reposes
on this law:—</p>

<p>Progress benefits the producer, as
such, only during the time necessary
to recompense his skill. It soon
produces a fall of value, and leaves to
the first imitators a fair, but small,
recompense. At length value
becomes proportioned to the diminished labour, and the whole
saving accrues to society at large.</p>

<p>Thus all profit by the progress of each, and each profits by the
progress of all. The principle, <em class="e000I2">each for all, all for each</em>, put forward
by the Socialists, and which they would have us receive as a novelty,
the germ of which is to be discovered in their organizations founded
on oppression and constraint, God himself has given us; and He has
educed it from liberty. <a id="p333" class="xxpn">[p333]</a></p>

<p>God, I say, has given us this principle, and He has not established
it in a model community, presided over by M. Considérant, or in
a <em class="e000I2">Phalanstère</em> of six hundred <em class="e000I2">harmoniens</em>, or in a tentative <em class="e000I2">Icarie</em>,<a
href="#FN_67" id="FNa_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>
on condition that a few fanatics should submit themselves to the
arbitrary power of a monomaniac, and that the faithless should pay
for the true believers. No, God has established the principle <em class="e000I2">each
for all and all for each</em> generally, universally, by a marvellous
mechanism, in which justice, liberty, utility, and sociability are
mingled and reconciled in such a degree as ought to discourage
these manufacturers of social organizations.</p>

<p>Observe that this great law of <em class="e000I2">each for all and all for each</em> is
much more universal than my demonstration supposes it. Words
are dull and heavy, and the pen still more so. The writer is
obliged to exhibit successively, and one after the other, with despairing
slowness, phenomena which recommend themselves to
our admiration only in the aggregate.</p>

<p>Thus, I have just spoken of <em class="e000I2">inventions</em>. You might conclude
that this was the only case in which progress, once attained, escapes
from the producer, and goes to enlarge the common fund of mankind.
It is not so. It is a general law that every advantage
of whatever kind, proceeding from local situation, climate, or any
other liberality of nature, slips rapidly from the hands of the person
who first discovered and appropriated it—not on that account
to be lost, but to go to feed the vast reservoir from which the enjoyments
of mankind are derived. One condition alone is attached,
which is, that labour and transactions should be free. To run
counter to liberty is to run counter to the designs of Providence;
it is to suspend the operation of God’s law, and limit progress in a
double sense.</p>

<p>What I have just said with reference to the transfer of advantages
holds equally true of evils and disadvantages. Nothing
remains permanently with the producer—neither advantages nor
inconveniences. Both tend to disseminate themselves through
society at large.</p>

<p>We have just seen with what avidity the producer seeks to avail
himself of whatever may facilitate his work; and we have seen,
too, in how short a time the profit arising from inventions and
discoveries slips from the inventor’s hands. It seems as if that
profit were not in the hands of a superior intelligence, but of a
blind and obedient instrument of general progress.</p>

<p>With the same ardour he shuns all that can shackle his action;
and this is a happy thing for the human race, for it is to mankind
<a id="p334" class="xxpn">[p334]</a> at large that in the long-run obstacles are prejudicial. Suppose,
for example, that A, the producer of books, is subjected to a heavy
tax. He must add the amount of that tax to the price of his books.
It will enter into the value of the books as a constituent part, the
effect of which will be that B, C, D, E must give more labour in exchange
for the same satisfaction. Their compensation will consist
in the purpose to which Government applies the tax. If the use
to which it is applied is beneficial, they may gain instead of losing
by the arrangement. If it is employed to oppress them, they
will suffer in a double sense. But as far as A is concerned, he is
relieved of the tax, although he pays it in the first instance.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that the producer does not frequently suffer
from obstacles of various kinds, and from taxes among others.
Sometimes he suffers most seriously from the operation of taxes,
and it is precisely on that account that taxes tend to shift their
incidence, and to fall ultimately on the masses.</p>

<p>Thus, in France, wine has been subjected to a multitude of exactions.
And then a system has been introduced which restricts
its sale abroad.</p>

<p>It is curious to observe what skips and bounds such burdens
make in passing from the producer to the consumer. No sooner
has the tax or restriction begun to operate than the producer endeavours
to indemnify himself. But the <em class="e000I2">demand</em> of the consumers,
as well as the supply of wine, remaining the same, the price
cannot rise. The producer gets no more for his wine after, than
he did before, the imposition of the tax. And as before the tax
he received no more than an ordinary and adequate price, determined
by services freely exchanged, he finds himself a loser by
the whole amount of the tax. To cause the price to rise, he is
obliged to diminish the quantity of wine produced.<a
href="#FN_68" id="FNa_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> . . . .&#160;.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&#160;.</p>

<p>The consumer, then,—the public,—is relatively to the loss or
profit which affects in the first instance certain classes of producers
what the earth is to electricity—the great common reservoir.
All proceeds from it, and after some detours, longer or
shorter as the case may be, and after having given rise to certain
phenomena more or less varied, all returns to it again.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>We have just shown that the economic effects only glance upon
the producer, so to speak, on their way to the consumer, and that
consequently all great and important questions of this kind must
<a id="p335" class="xxpn">[p335]</a> be regarded from the consumer’s point of view if we wish to make
ourselves masters of their general and permanent consequences.</p>

<p>This subordination of the interests of the producer to that of
the consumer, which we have deduced from the consideration of
<em class="e000I2">utility</em>, is fully confirmed when we advert to the consideration of
<em class="e000I2">morality</em>.</p>

<p>Responsibility, in fact, always rests with the initiative. Now
where is the initiative? In <em class="e000I2">demand</em>.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Demand</em> (which implies the means of remuneration) determines
all—the direction of capital and of labour, the distribution of
population, the morality of professions, etc. <em class="e000I2">Demand</em> answers to
Desire, while <em class="e000I2">Supply</em> answers to Effort. Desire is reasonable or
unreasonable, moral or immoral. Effort, which is only an effect,
is morally neuter, or has only a reflected morality.</p>

<p>Demand or Consumption says to the producer, “Make that for
me.” The producer obeys. And this would be evident in every
case if the producer always and everywhere waited for the
demand.</p>

<p>But in practice this is not the case.</p>

<p>Is it exchange which has led to the division of labour, or the
division of labour which has given rise to exchange? This is a
subtle and thorny question. Let us say that man makes exchanges,
because, being intelligent and sociable, he comprehends
that this is one means of increasing the proportion of result to
effort. That which results exclusively from the division of labour
and from foresight, is that a man does not wait for a specific
request to work for another. Experience teaches him tacitly that
demand exists.</p>

<p>He makes the effort beforehand which is to satisfy the demand,
and this gives rise to trades and professions. Beforehand he
makes shoes, hats, etc., or prepares himself to sing, to teach, to
plead, to fight, etc. But is it really the supply which precedes
the demand, and determines it?</p>

<p>No. It is because there is a sufficient certainty that these different
services will be demanded that men prepare to render them,
although they do not always know precisely from what quarter
the demand may come. And the proof of it is, that the relation
between these different services is sufficiently well known, that
their value has been so widely tested that one may devote himself
with some security to a particular manufacture, or embrace a particular
career.</p>

<p>The impulse of demand is then pre-existent, seeing that one
may calculate the intensity of it with so much precision. <a id="p336" class="xxpn">[p336]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, when a man betakes himself to a particular trade or
profession, and sets himself to produce commodities, about what
is he solicitous? Is it about the utility of the article which he
manufactures, or its results, good or bad, moral or immoral? Not
at all; he thinks only of its <em class="e000I2">value</em>. It is the demander who looks
to the <em class="e000I2">utility</em>. Utility answers to his want, his desire, his caprice.
Value, on the contrary, has relation only to the effort made, to
the service transferred. It is only when, by means of exchange,
the producer in his turn becomes the demander that utility is
looked to. When I resolve to manufacture hats rather than
shoes, I do not ask myself the question, whether men have a
greater interest in protecting their heads or their heels. No,
that concerns the demander, and determines the demand. The
demand in its turn determines the value, or the degree of esteem
in which the public holds the service. Value, in short, determines
the effort or the supply.</p>

<p>Hence result some very remarkable consequences in a moral
point of view. Two nations may be equally furnished with values,
that is to say, with relative wealth (see chap. vi), and very unequally
provided with real utilities, or absolute wealth; and this
happens when one of them forms desires which are more unreasonable
than those of the other—when the one considers its real wants,
and the other creates for itself wants which are factitious or
immoral.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Among one people a taste for education may predominate;
among another a taste for good living. In such circumstances we
render a service to the first when we have something to teach
them; to the other, when we please their palate.</p>

<p>Now, services are remunerated according to the degree of importance
we attach to them. If we do not exchange, if we render
these services to ourselves, what should determine us if not the
nature and intensity of our desires?</p>

<p>In one of the countries we have supposed, professors and
teachers will abound; in the other, cooks.</p>

<p>In both, the services exchanged may be equal in the aggregate,
and may consequently represent equal values, or equal relative
wealth, but not the same absolute wealth. In other words, the
one employs its labour well, and the other employs it ill.</p>

<p>And as regards satisfactions the result will be this, that the one
people will have much instruction, and the other good dinners.
The ultimate consequences of this diversity of tastes will have considerable
influence not only upon real, but upon relative wealth;
<a id="p337" class="xxpn">[p337]</a> for education may develop new means of rendering services, which
good dinners never can.</p>

<p>We remark among nations a prodigious diversity of tastes,
arising from their antecedents, their character, their opinions,
their vanity, etc.</p>

<p>No doubt there are some wants so imperious (hunger and thirst,
for example) that we regard them as determinate quantities. And
yet it is not uncommon to see a man scrimp himself of food in
order to have good clothes, while another never thinks of his dress
until his appetite is satisfied. The same thing holds of nations.</p>

<p>But these imperious wants once satisfied, everything else
depends greatly on the will. It becomes an affair of taste, and
in that region morality and good sense have much influence.</p>

<p>The intensity of the various national desires determines always
the quantity of labour which each people subtracts from the
aggregate of its efforts in order to satisfy each of its desires. An
Englishman must, above all things, be well fed. For this reason
he devotes an enormous amount of his labour to the production
of food, and if he produces any other commodities, it is with the
intention of exchanging them abroad for alimentary substances.
The quantity of corn, meat, butter, milk, sugar, etc., consumed in
England is frightful. A Frenchman desires to be amused. He
delights in what pleases his eye, and in frequent changes. His
labours are in accordance with his tastes. Hence we have in
France multitudes of singers, mountebanks, milliners, elegant
shops, coffee-rooms, etc. In China, the natives dream away life
agreeably under the influence of opium, and this is the reason why
so great an amount of their national labour is devoted to procuring
this precious narcotic, either by direct production, or indirectly
by means of exchange. In Spain, where the pomp of religious
worship is carried to so great a height, the exertions of the people
are bestowed on the decoration of churches, etc.</p>

<p>I shall not go the length of asserting that there is no immorality
in services which pander to immoral and depraved desires. But
the immoral principle is obviously in the desire itself.</p>

<p>That would be beyond doubt were man living in a state of
isolation; and it is equally true as regards man in society, for
society is only individuality enlarged.</p>

<p>Who then would think of blaming our labourers in the south of
France for producing brandy? They satisfy a <em class="e000I2">demand</em>. They
dig their vineyards, dress their vines, gather and distil the grapes,
without concerning themselves about the use which will be made
of the product. It is for the man who seeks the enjoyment to
<a id="p338" class="xxpn">[p338]</a> consider whether it is proper, moral, rational, or productive of
good. The responsibility rests with him. The business of the
world could be conducted on no other footing. Is the tailor to
tell his customer that he cannot make him a coat of the fashion
he wants because it is extravagant, or because it prevents his
breathing freely, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Then what concern is it of our poor vine-dressers if rich diners-out
in London indulge too freely in claret? Or can we seriously
accuse the English of raising opium in India with the deliberate
intention of poisoning the Chinese?</p>

<p>A frivolous people requires frivolous manufactures, just as a
serious people requires industry of a more serious kind. If the
human race is to be improved, it must be by the improved
morality of the consumer, not of the producer.</p>

<p>This is the design of religion in addressing the rich—the great
<em class="e000I2">consumers</em>—so seriously on their immense responsibility. From
another point of view, and employing a different language, Political
Economy arrives at the same conclusion, when she affirms that we
cannot check the <em class="e000I2">supply</em> of any commodity which is in <em class="e000I2">demand</em>;
that as regards the producer, the commodity is simply a <em class="e000I2">value</em>, a
sort of current coin which represents nothing either good or evil,
whilst it is in the intention of the consumer that <em class="e000I2">utility</em>, or moral
or immoral enjoyment, is to be discovered; consequently, that it
is incumbent on the man who manifests the desire or makes the
demand for the commodity to weigh the consequences, whether
useful or hurtful, and to answer before God and man for the good
or bad direction which he impresses upon industry.</p>

<p>Thus from whatever point of view we regard the subject, we see
clearly that consumption is the great end of Political Economy;
and that good and evil, morality and immorality, harmonies and
dissonances, all come to centre in the consumer, for he represents
mankind at large. <a id="p339" class="xxpn">[p339]</a></p>

<h2 title="XII. The Two Aphorisms"><a id="XII"></a>XII.<br />
THE TWO APHORISMS.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
Modern moralists who oppose the maxim, <em class="e000I2">Chacun pour tous, tous
pour chacun</em>, to the old proverb, <em class="e000I2">Chacun pour soi, chacun chez soi</em>,
have formed a very incomplete, and for that reason a very false,
and, I would add, a very melancholy idea of Society.</p>

<p>Let us eliminate, in the first place, from these two celebrated
sayings what is superfluous. <em class="e000I2">All for each</em> is a redundancy, introduced
from love of antithesis, for it is expressly included in <em class="e000I2">each
for all</em>. As regards the saying <em class="e000I2">chacun chez soi</em>, the idea has no
direct relation with the others; but, as it is of great importance
in Political Economy, we shall make it hereafter the subject of
inquiry.</p>

<p>It remains for us to consider the assumed opposition between
these two members of the adages we have quoted, namely, <em class="e000I2">each for
all</em>—<em class="e000I2">each for himself</em>. The one, it is said, expresses the sympathetic
principle, the other the individualist or selfish principle.
The first unites, the second divides.</p>

<p>Now, if we refer exclusively to the motive which determines
the effort, the opposition is incontestable. But I maintain that if
we consider the aggregate of human efforts in their results, the case
is different. Examine Society, as it actually exists, obeying, as
regards services which are capable of remuneration, the individualist
or selfish principle; and you will be at once convinced that
every man in working <em class="e000I2">for himself</em> is in fact working <em class="e000I2">for all</em>. This
is beyond doubt. If the reader of these lines exercises a profession
or trade, I entreat him for a moment to turn his regards upon
himself; and I would ask him whether all his labours have not
the satisfaction of others for their object, and, on the other hand,
whether it is not to the exertions of others that he himself owes
all his satisfactions.</p>

<p>It is evident that they who assert that <em class="e000I2">each for himself</em> and <em class="e000I2">each</em>
<a id="p340" class="xxpn">[p340]</a> <em class="e000I2">for all</em> are contradictory, conceive that an incompatibility exists
between individualism and association. They think that <em class="e000I2">each for
himself</em> implies isolation, or a tendency to isolation; that personal
interest divides men, in place of uniting them, and that this principle
tends to the <em class="e000I2">chacun chez soi</em>, that is to say, to the absence
of all social relations.</p>

<p>In taking this view, I repeat, they form a false, because incomplete
idea of society. Even when moved only by personal interest,
men seek to draw nearer each other, to combine their efforts, to
unite their forces, to work for one another, to render reciprocal
services, to <em class="e000I2">associate</em>. It would not be correct to say that they
act in this way in spite of self-interest; they do so in obedience
to self-interest. They <em class="e000I2">associate</em> because they find their account
in it. If they did not find it for their advantage, they would not
associate. Individualism, then, or a regard to personal interest,
performs the work which the sentimentalists of our day would confide
to Fraternity, to self-sacrifice, or some other motive opposed
to self-love. And this just establishes the conclusion at which we
never fail to arrive—that Providence has provided for the social
state much better than the men can who call themselves its
prophets. For of two things one; either union is injurious to
individuality, or it is advantageous to it. If it injures it, what
are the Socialist gentlemen to do, how can they manage, and what
rational motive can they have to bring about a state of things
which is hurtful to everybody? If, on the contrary, union is
advantageous, it will be brought about by the action of personal
interest, which is the strongest, the most permanent, the most
uniform, the most universal, of all motives, let men say what
they will.</p>

<p>Just look at how the thing actually works in practice. A
<em class="e000I2">squatter</em> goes away to clear a field in the <em class="e000I2">Far West</em>. Not a day
passes without his experiencing the difficulties which isolation
creates. A second squatter now makes his way to the desert.
Where does he pitch his tent? Does he retire <em class="e000I2">naturally</em> to a
distance from the first? No; he draws near to him <em class="e000I2">naturally</em>—and
why? Because he knows all the advantages that men derive,
with equal exertion, from the very circumstance of proximity. He
knows that on various occasions they can accommodate each other
by lending and borrowing tools and instruments, by uniting their
action, by conquering difficulties insurmountable by individual
exertion, by creating reciprocally a market for produce, by interchanging
their views and opinions, and by providing for their
common safety. A third, a fourth, a fifth squatter penetrates into
<a id="p341" class="xxpn">[p341]</a> the desert, and is invariably attracted by the smoke of the first
settlements. Other people will then step in with larger capital,
knowing that they will find hands there ready to be set to work.
A colony is formed. They change somewhat the mode of culture;
they form a path to the highway, by which the mail passes; they
import and export; construct a church, a school-house, etc., etc.
In a word, the power of the colonists is augmented by the very
fact of their proximity, and to such a degree as to exceed, to
an incalculable extent, the sum of their isolated and individual
forces; and this is the motive which has attracted them towards
each other.</p>

<p>But it may be said that <em class="e000I2">every man for himself</em> is a frigid maxim,
which all the reasoning and paradoxes in the world cannot render
otherwise than repugnant; that it smells of egotism a mile off, and
that egotism is more than an evil in society, being itself the source
of most other evils.</p>

<p>Now, listen a little, if you please.</p>

<p>If the maxim <em class="e000I2">every man for himself</em> is understood in this sense,
that it is to regulate all our thoughts, acts, and relations, that we
are to find it at the root of all our family and domestic affections,
as fathers, sons, brothers, husbands, friends, citizens, or rather that
it is to repress and to extinguish these affections, then I admit that
it is frightful, horrible, and such, that were there one man upon the
earth heartless enough to make it the rule of his conduct, that man
dared not even proclaim it in theory.</p>

<p>But will the Socialists, in the teeth of fact and experience, always
refuse to admit that there are two orders of human relations—one
dependent on the sympathetic principle, and which we leave to
the domain of morals,—another springing from self-interest, and
regulating transactions between men who know nothing of each
other, and owe each other nothing but justice,—transactions
regulated by voluntary covenants freely adjusted? Covenants of
this last species are precisely those which come within the domain
of Political Economy. It is, in truth, no more possible to base
commercial transactions on the principle of sympathy, than it is to
base family and friendly relations on self-interest. To the Socialists
I shall never cease to address this remonstrance: You wish to
mix up two things which cannot be confounded. If you were fools
enough to wish to confound them, you have not the power to do
it. The blacksmith, the carpenter, and the labourer, who exhaust
their strength in rude avocations, may be excellent fathers, admirable
sons; they may have the moral sense thoroughly developed,
and carry in their breasts hearts of large and expansive sympathy.
<a id="p342" class="xxpn">[p342]</a> In spite of all that, you will never persuade them to labour from
morning to night with the sweat of their brow, and impose upon
themselves the hardest privations, upon a mere principle of devotion
to their fellow-men. Your sentimental lectures on this
subject are, and always will be, powerless. If, unfortunately,
they could mislead a few operatives, they would just make so
many dupes. Let the merchant set to work to sell his wares
on the principle of Fraternity, and I venture to predict that, in
less than a month, he will see himself and his children reduced
to beggary.</p>

<p>Providence has done well, then, in giving to the social state very
different guarantees. Taking man as we find him,—sensibility and
individuality, benevolence and self-love being inseparable,—we
cannot hope, we cannot desire to see the motive of personal interest
universally eradicated—nor can we understand how it could be.
And yet nothing short of this would be necessary in order to
restore the equilibrium of human relations; for if you break this
mainspring of action only in certain chosen spirits, you create two
classes,—scoundrels whom you thus tempt to make victims of
their fellow-men—and the virtuous, for whom the part of victims
is reserved.</p>

<p>Seeing, then, that as regards labour and exchanges, the principle
<em class="e000I2">each for himself</em> must inevitably have the predominance as a motive
of action, the marvellous and admirable thing is, that the Author of
all should have made use of that principle in order to realize, in
the social order, the maxim of the advocates of Fraternity, <em class="e000I2">each for
all</em>. In His skilful hand the obstacle has become the instrument.
The general interest has been intrusted to personal interest, and
the one has become infallible because the other is indestructible.
To me it would seem that, in presence of these wondrous results,
the constructors of artificial societies might, without any excess of
humility, acknowledge that, as regards organization, the Divine
Architect has far surpassed them.</p>

<p>Remark, too, that in the natural order of society, the principle
of <em class="e000I2">each for all</em>, based upon the principle of <em class="e000I2">each for himself</em>, is much
more complete, much more absolute, much more personal, than it
would be in the Socialist and Communist point of view. Not
only do we work for all, but we cannot realize a single step of
progress without its being profitable to the Community at large.
(See chapter x., and <em class="e000I2">ante</em>, chapter xi.) The order of things has
been so marvellously arranged, that when we have invented a new
process, or discovered the liberality of nature in any department—some
new source of fertility in the soil, or some new mode of
<a id="p343" class="xxpn">[p343]</a> action in one of the laws of the physical world,—the profit is
ours temporarily, transiently, so long as to prove just as a recompense,
and useful as an encouragement,—after which the
advantage escapes from our grasp, in spite of all our efforts to
retain it. From individual it becomes social, and falls for ever
into the domain of the common and the gratuitous. And while
we thus impart the fruits of our progress to our fellow-men, we
ourselves become participators in the progress which other men
have achieved.</p>

<p>In short, by the rule <em class="e000I2">each for himself</em>, individual efforts, reinforced
and invigorated, act in the direction of <em class="e000I2">each for all</em>, and
every partial step of progress brings a thousand times more to
society, in gratuitous utility, than it has brought to its inventor in
direct profits.</p>

<p>With the maxim <em class="e000I2">each for all</em> no one would act exclusively <em class="e000I2">for
himself</em>. What producer would take it into his head to double
his labour in order to add a thirty-millionth part to his wages?</p>

<p>It may be said, then, why refute the Socialist aphorism?
What harm can it do? Undoubtedly it will not introduce into
workshops, counting-rooms, warehouses, nor establish in fairs and
markets, the principle of self-sacrifice. But then it will either
tend to nothing, and then we may let it sleep in peace, or it will
bend somewhat that stiffness of the egotistical principle, which,
excluding all sympathy, has scarcely right to claim any.</p>

<p>What is false is always dangerous. It is always a dangerous
thing to represent as detestable and pernicious an eternal and
universal principle which God has evidently destined to the
conservation and advancement of the human race; a principle,
I allow, as far as motive is concerned, which does not come
home to our heart, but which, when viewed with reference to
its results, astonishes and satisfies the mind; a principle, moreover,
which leaves the field perfectly free to the action of those
more elevated motives which God has implanted in the heart of
man.</p>

<p>But, then, what happens? The Socialist public adopts only
one-half the Socialist maxim—the last half, <em class="e000I2">all for each</em>. They
continue as before to work <em class="e000I2">each for himself</em>, but they require, over
and above, that all should work for them.</p>

<p>It must be so. When dreamers desired to change the grand
mainspring of human exertion, by substituting fraternity for individualism,
they found it necessary to invent a hypocritical contradiction.
They set themselves to call out to the masses,—“Stifle
self-love in your hearts and follow us; you will be rewarded for it
<a id="p344" class="xxpn">[p344]</a> by unbounded wealth and enjoyment.” When men try to parody
the Gospel, they should come to a Gospel conclusion. Self-denial
implies sacrifice and pain—self-devotion means, “Take the lowest
seat, be poor, and suffer voluntarily.” But under pretence of abnegation
to promise enjoyment; to exhibit wealth and prosperity
behind the pretended sacrifice; to combat a passion which they
brand with the name of egotism by addressing themselves to the
grossest and most material tendencies;—this is not only to render
homage to the indestructible vitality of the principle they desire to
overthrow, but to exalt it to the highest point while declaiming
against it; it is to double the forces of the enemy, instead of
conquering him; to substitute unjust covetousness for legitimate
individualism; and, in spite of all the artifice of a mystical
jargon, to excite the grossest sensualism. Let avarice answer
this appeal.<a
href="#FN_69" id="FNa_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>And is that not the position in which we now are? What is
the universal cry among all ranks and classes? <em class="e000I2">All for each.</em> In
pronouncing the word <em class="e000I2">each</em>, we are thinking of ourselves, and
what we ask is to have a share which we have not merited, in
the fruits of other men’s labour. In other words, we systematize
spoliation. No doubt, spoliation, simple and naked, is so unjust
that we repudiate it; but, by dint of the maxim <em class="e000I2">all for each</em>, we
allay the scruples of conscience. We impose upon others the
<em class="e000I2">duty</em> of working for us, and we arrogate to ourselves the <em class="e000I2">right</em> to
enjoy the fruits of other men’s labour. We summon the State,
the law, to impose the pretended <em class="e000I2">duty</em>, to protect the pretended
<em class="e000I2">right</em>, and we arrive at the whimsical result of robbing one another
in the sacred name of Fraternity. We live at other men’s expense,
and attribute heroism to the sacrifice. What an odd, strange thing
the human mind is! and how subtle is covetousness! It is not
enough that each of us should endeavour to increase his share at
the expense of his fellows, it is not enough that we should desire
to profit by labour that we have not performed; we persuade ourselves
that in acting thus we are displaying a sublime example of
self-sacrifice. We almost go the length of comparing ourselves
to the primitive Christians, and yet we blind ourselves so far as
not to see that the sacrifices which make us weep in fond admiration
<a id="p345" class="xxpn">[p345]</a> of our own virtue, are sacrifices which we do not make, but
which, on the contrary, we exact.<a
href="#FN_70" id="FNa_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>It is worth observing the manner in which this mystification is
effected.</p>

<p>Steal! Oh fy, that is mean—besides it leads to the hulks, for
the law forbids it. But if the law authorized it, and lent its
aid, would not that be very convenient?&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.
What a happy thought!&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>No time is lost in soliciting from the law some trifling privilege,
a small monopoly, and as it may cost some pains to protect it, the
State is asked to take it under its charge. The State and the
law come to an understanding to realize exactly that which it was
their business to prevent or to punish. By degrees the taste for
monopolies gains ground. No class but desires a monopoly. <em class="e000I2">All
for each</em>, they cry; we desire also to appear as philanthropists, and
show that we understand solidarity.</p>

<p>It happens that the privileged classes, in thus robbing each
other, lose at least as much by the exactions to which they are
subject, as they gain by the contributions which they levy.
Besides, the great body of the working classes, to whom no
monopolies can be accorded, suffer from them until they can
endure it no longer. They rise up, and cover the streets with
barricades and blood; and then we must come to a reckoning
with them.</p>

<p>What is their demand? Do they require the abolition of the
abuses, privileges, monopolies, and restrictions under which they
suffer? Not at all. They also are imbued with philanthropy.
They have been told that the celebrated apophthegm <em class="e000I2">all for each</em>
is the solution of the social problem. They have had it demonstrated
to them over and over again that monopoly (which in
reality is only a theft) is nevertheless quite moral if sanctioned
by law. Then they demand&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. What?&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. Monopolies!
They also summon the State to supply them with education,
employment, credit, assistance, at the expense of the people.
What a strange illusion! and how long will it last? We can
very well conceive how all the higher classes, beginning with the
highest, can come to demand favours and privileges. Below them
there is a great popular mass upon whom the burden falls. But
that the people, when once conquerors, should take it into their
heads to enter into the privileged class, and create monopolies for
themselves at their own expense; that they should enlarge the
area of abuses in order to live upon them; that they should not
<a id="p346" class="xxpn">[p346]</a> see that there is nothing below them to support those acts of
injustice: this is one of the most astonishing phenomena of our
age, or of any age.</p>

<p>What has been the consequence? By pursuing this course,
Society has been brought to the verge of shipwreck. Men became
alarmed, and with reason. The people soon lost their
power, and the old spread of abuses has been provisionally
resumed.</p>

<p>The lesson, however, has not been quite lost upon the higher
classes. They find that it is necessary to do justice to the working
class. They ardently desire to succeed in this, not only because
their own security depends upon it, but impelled, as we must
acknowledge, by a spirit of equity. Of this I am thoroughly
convinced, that the wealthier classes desire nothing more than to
discover the solution of the great problem. I am satisfied that if
we were to ask the greater part of our wealthy citizens to give up
a considerable portion of their fortune in order to secure the future
happiness and contentment of the people, they would cheerfully
make the sacrifice. They anxiously seek the means of coming
(according to the consecrated phrase) <em class="e000I2">to the assistance of the labouring
classes</em>. But for that end on what plan have they fallen!&#160;.&#160;.
Still the communism of monopolies; a mitigated communism,
however, and which they hope to subject to prudential regulation.
That is all—they go no farther. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

<p class="chapterhead">
If, with an increase in the value of land, a corresponding augmentation
took place in the value of the products of the soil, I could
understand the opposition which the theory I have explained in
the present work (chap. ix.) has encountered. It might be argued,
“that in proportion as civilisation is developed the condition of the
labourer becomes worse in comparison with that of the proprietor.
This may be an inevitable necessity, but assuredly it is not a law
of harmony.”</p>

<p>Happily it is not so. In general those circumstances which
cause an augmentation of the value of land diminish at the same
time the price of landed produce.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. Let me explain this by
an example.</p>

<p>Suppose a field worth £100 situated ten leagues from a town.
A road is made which passes near this field, and opens up a market
for its produce. The field immediately becomes worth £150. The
proprietor having by this means acquired facilities for improvement
and for a more varied culture, then increases the value of the land,
and it comes to be worth £200.</p>

<p>The value of the field is now doubled. Let us examine this
added value—both as regards the question of justice and as regards
the utility which accrues, not to the proprietor, but to the
consumers of the neighbouring town.</p>

<p>As far as concerns the increase of value arising from ameliorations
which the proprietor has made at his own cost, there can
be no question. The capital he has expended follows the law of
all capital.</p>

<p>I venture to say the same thing of the capital expended in
<a id="p348" class="xxpn">[p348]</a> forming the road. The operation is more circuitous, but the result
is the same.</p>

<p>In point of fact, the proprietor has contributed to the public
expenditure in proportion to the value of his field. For many
years he contributed to works of general utility executed in more
remote parts of the country, and at length a road has been made
in a direction which is profitable to him. The gross amount of
taxes which he has paid may be compared to shares taken in a
Government enterprise, and the annual augmentation of rent which
he derives from the formation of this new road may be compared
to <em class="e000I2">dividends</em> upon these shares.</p>

<p>Will it be said that a proprietor may pay taxes for ever, without
receiving anything in return?&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. But this just comes back
to the case we have already put. The amelioration, although
effected by the complex and somewhat questionable process of
taxation, may be considered as made by the proprietor at his own
cost, in proportion to the partial advantage he derives from it.</p>

<p>I have put the case of a road. I might have cited any other
instance of Government intervention. Security, for example,
contributes to give value to land, like capital, or labour. But
who pays for this security? The proprietor, the capitalist, the
labourer.</p>

<p>If the State expends its revenue judiciously, the value expended
will reappear and be replaced, in some form or other, in the hands
of the proprietor, the capitalist, or the labourer. In the case of the
proprietor, it must take the form of an increase in the value of his
land. If, on the other hand, the State expends its revenue
injudiciously, it is a misfortune. The tax is lost; and that is the
taxpayer’s look-out. In that case, there is no augmentation of
the value of the land, but that is no fault of the proprietor.</p>

<p>But for the produce of the soil thus augmented in value, by the
action of Government and by individual industry, do the consumers
of the neighbouring town pay an enhanced price? In other
words, does the interest of the £100 become a charge on each
quarter of wheat which the field produces? If we paid formerly
£15 for it, shall we now be obliged to pay more than £15? That
is an interesting question, seeing that justice and the universal
harmony of interests depend on its solution.</p>

<p>I answer boldly, <em class="e000I2">No</em>.</p>

<p>No doubt the proprietor will now get £5 more (I assume the
rate of interest to be 5 per cent.); but he gets this addition at the
expense of nobody. On the contrary, the purchaser will derive a
still greater profit. <a id="p349" class="xxpn">[p349]</a></p>

<p>The field we have supposed having been formerly at a distance
from the market, was made to produce little, and on account of
the difficulty of transit what was sent to market sold at a high
price. Now, production is stimulated, and transport made cheaper,
a greater quantity of wheat comes to market, and comes there at
less cost, and is sold cheaper. Whilst yielding the proprietor a
total profit of £5, its purchaser, as we have already said, may
realize a still greater profit.</p>

<p>In short, an economy of power has been realized. For whose
benefit? For the benefit of both of the contracting parties.
According to what law is this gain distributed? According to
the law which we have described in the case of capital, seeing that
this augmentation of value is itself capital.</p>

<p>When capital increases, the portion falling to the proprietor or
capitalist increases in absolute value and diminishes in relative
value; while the portion falling to the labourer (or consumer)
increases both in absolute and relative value.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>Observe how this takes place. In proportion as civilisation
advances, lands which are situated near populous centres rise in
value. Productions of an inferior kind in such places give way to
productions of a superior description. First of all, pasture gives
way to cereal crops, then cereal crops give way to market gardening.
Products are brought from a greater distance at less cost,
so that (and this in point of fact is incontestable) meat, bread,
vegetables, even flowers, are sold in such places cheaper than
in neighbourhoods less advanced, although manual labour costs
more.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p class="center">LE CLOS-VOUGEOT.<a href="#FN_72" id="FNa_72"

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. <em class="e000I2">Services are exchanged for services.</em> Frequently
services prepared beforehand are exchanged for present or future
services.</p>

<p>The value of services is determined not by the labour they exact
or have exacted, but by the labour which they save.</p>

<p>Now, in point of fact, human labour goes on constantly improving
in efficiency.</p>

<p>From these premises we may deduce a phenomenon which is very
important in social economy, which is, that <em class="e000I2">in general</em> anterior
labour loses in exchange with present labour.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago I manufactured a commodity which cost me
<a id="p350" class="xxpn">[p350]</a> 100 days’ labour. I propose an exchange, and I say to the
purchaser, Give me in exchange a thing which cost you also 100
days’ labour. Probably he will be in a situation to make this
reply, That great progress has been made in twenty years. What
you ask 100 days’ labour for can be made now in 70 days. I
don’t measure your service by the time it has cost you, but by the
service it renders me. That service is equal only to 70 days’
labour, for in that time I can render it to myself, or find one who
will render it to me.</p>

<p>The consequence is that the value of capital goes on continually
deteriorating, and that anterior labour and capital are not so much
favoured as superficial economists believe.</p>

<p>Apart from tear and wear, there is no machine a little old but
loses value, for the single reason that better machines of the same
kind are made nowadays.</p>

<p>The same thing holds in regard to land. There are few soils, to
bring which into their present state of culture and fertility, has
not cost more labour than would be necessary now with our more
effective modern appliances.</p>

<p>This is what happens in the <em class="e000I2">usual</em> case, but not <em class="e000I2">necessarily</em> so.</p>

<p>Anterior labour may, at the present day, render greater services
than it did formerly. This is rare, but it sometimes happens. For
example, I store up wine which cost me twenty days’ labour to
produce. Had I sold it immediately, my labour would have
yielded me a certain remuneration. I have preserved my wine;
it has improved; the succeeding vintage has failed; in short, the
price has risen, and my remuneration is greater. Why? Because
I render a greater amount of service—my customers would have
greater difficulty in procuring themselves such wine than I myself
experienced—I satisfy a want which has become greater, more
felt, etc.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>This is a consideration which must always be looked to.</p>

<p>There are a thousand of us. Each has his piece of land, and
clears it. Some time elapses, and we sell it. Now it so happens
that out of 1000 there are 998 who never receive as many days’
present labour in exchange for their land as it cost them formerly;
and this just because the anterior labour, which was of a ruder
and less efficient description, does not render as great an amount
of service comparatively as present labour. But there are two of
the proprietors whose labour has been more intelligent, or, if you
will, more successful. When they bring their land to market,
they find that it is capable of rendering service which cannot be
rivalled. Every man says to himself, It would cost me a great
<a id="p351" class="xxpn">[p351]</a> deal to render this service to myself, therefore I must pay well for
it, for I am quite certain that it would cost me more to obtain
what I am in quest of by my own exertions.</p>

<p>This is just the case of the celebrated vineyard, the Clos-Vougeot,
and it is the same case as that of the man who finds
a diamond, or possesses a fine voice, or other personal advantages
or peculiarities, etc. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>In my neighbourhood there is much uncultivated land. A
stranger asks, Why not cultivate this field? Because the soil is bad.
But here, alongside of it, you have another of the same quality
which is cultivated. To this objection the native has no answer.</p>

<p>Was he wrong in the first answer he gave, namely, <em class="e000I2">It is bad</em>?</p>

<p>No. The reason which induces him not to clear new fields is
not that they are bad, for there are excellent fields which also
remain uncultivated. His reason is that it would cost him more
to bring this field into the same state of cultivation as the adjoining
field which is cultivated, than to buy the latter.</p>

<p>Now, to any thinking man this proves incontestably that the
field has no intrinsic value.</p>

<p>(Illustrate this idea by considering it in various points of view.)<a

<p class="chapterhead">
Men are always anxiously on the outlook for something fixed.
We meet sometimes with restless and unquiet spirits who have a
craving for risk and adventure. But, taking mankind in the gross,
we may safely affirm that what they desire is to be tranquil as
regards their future, to know what they have to count upon, and
be enabled to make their arrangements beforehand. To be convinced
how precious fixity is in their eyes, we have only to observe
how very anxious men are to obtain for themselves Government
employments. Nor is this on account of the honour which such
places confer, for there are many of these situations where the work
is not of a very elevated description, consisting in watching and
vexing their fellow-citizens, and prying into their affairs. Such
places, however, are not the less sought after—and why? Because
they confer an assured position. Who has not heard a father speak
<a id="p353" class="xxpn">[p353]</a>
thus of his son: “I am soliciting for him a place as a candidate or
supernumerary in such or such a Government office. It is a pity,
no doubt, that so costly an education is required—an education
which might have ensured his success in a more brilliant career.
As a public functionary he will not get rich, but he is certain to
live. He will always have bread. Four or five years hence he
will begin to receive a salary of thirty pounds a year, which will
rise by degrees to a hundred and twenty or a hundred and sixty.
After thirty years’ service he will be entitled to retire. His livelihood
then is secured, and he must learn to live upon a small
income,” etc.</p>

<p>Fixity, then, has for most men an irresistible attraction.</p>

<p>And yet, when we consider the nature of man, and of his
occupations, fixity would seem to be incompatible with them.</p>

<p>Go back in imagination to the origin of human society, and you
will have difficulty in comprehending how men can ever succeed
in obtaining from the community a fixed, assured, and constant
quantity of the means of subsistence. Yet this is one of those
phenomena which strike us less because we have them constantly
before our eyes. We have public functionaries who receive fixed
salaries; proprietors who can count beforehand on their revenues;
men of fortune who can calculate on their dividends; workmen
who earn every day the same wages. Apart from the consideration
of money, which is only employed to facilitate exchanges and
estimates of value, we perceive that what is fixed is the quantity of
the means of subsistence, the value of the satisfactions received by
the various classes of workmen. Now, I maintain that this fixity,
which by degrees extends to all men and all departments of industry,
is a miracle of civilisation, and a marvellous effect of that
social state which, in our day, is so madly decried.</p>

<p>For, let us go back to a primitive social state, and suppose a
nation of hunters, or fishers, or shepherds, or warriors, or agriculturists,
to be told, “In proportion as you advance on the road of
progress, you will know more and more beforehand what amount
of enjoyment will be secured to you for each year,” they would not
believe us. They would reply, “That must always depend on
something which eludes calculation,—the inconstancy of the seasons,
etc.” The truth is, they could form no idea of the ingenious efforts
by means of which men have succeeded in establishing a sort of
mutual assurance between all places and all times.</p>

<p>Now, this mutual assurance against all the risks and chances of
the future is entirely dependent on a branch of human science
which I shall denominate <em class="e000I2">experimental statistics</em>. This department
<a id="p354" class="xxpn">[p354]</a> of science, depending as it does upon experience, admits of indefinite
progress, and consequently the fixity of which we have spoken
also admits of indefinite progress. That fixity is favoured by two
circumstances which are permanent in their operation: 1<em class="e000I2">st</em>, Men
desire it. 2<em class="e000I2">dly</em>, They acquire every day greater facilities for
realizing it.</p>

<p>Before showing how this fixity is established in human transactions,
in which it is little thought of, let us first of all see how it
operates in a transaction of which it is the special object. The
reader will, in this way, comprehend what I mean by experimental
statistics.</p>

<p>A number of men have each a house. One of these houses
happens to be burnt down and its owner is ruined. All the rest
immediately take alarm, and each says to himself, “The same thing
may happen to me.” We cannot be surprised, then, that these
proprietors should unite and divide the risk of such accidents as
much as possible, by establishing a mutual assurance against fire.
The bargain is very simple—here is its formula: “If the house of
one of us is burnt down, the rest will club to make good the loss to
the man who is burnt out.”</p>

<p>By this means each proprietor acquires a double security; in the
first instance he must take a small share in all losses of this nature;
but then he is assured that he will never himself be obliged to
suffer the whole loss arising from any such misfortune.</p>

<p>In reality, and if we extend the calculation over a great number
of years, we see that the proprietor makes, so to speak, a bargain
with himself. He sets aside a sufficient fund to repair the misfortunes
which may afterwards befall him.</p>

<p>This is <em class="e000I2">association</em>. Indeed it is to arrangements of this nature
that the Socialists give exclusively the name of <em class="e000I2">association</em>. Whenever
speculation intervenes, association, as they think, disappears.
It is improved and perfected, as I think, and as we shall afterwards
see.</p>

<p>What has led the proprietors to associate, to enter into this
mutual assurance, is the love of fixity, of security. They prefer
known risks to risks which are unknown, a multitude of small
risks to one great one.</p>

<p>Their design, however, has not yet been completely attained, and
there is still much uncertainty in their position. Each of them
may say, “If accidents are multiplied, my <em class="e000I2">quota</em> will become
insupportable. In any case, I should like to know beforehand,
and to have insured in the same way my furniture, my merchandise,
etc.” <a id="p355" class="xxpn">[p355]</a></p>

<p>It would seem that such inconveniences belong to the nature of
things, and that it is impossible for men to get rid of them. After
each step of progress we are tempted to think that all has been
accomplished. How, indeed, can we elude this <em class="e000I2">uncertainty</em>, which
depends upon accidents still unknown to us?</p>

<p>But mutual assurance has developed in the social state an
experimental knowledge, namely, the average annual proportion
between the values lost by accident and the values
assured.</p>

<p>Having made all the necessary calculations, a company or an
individual says to the proprietors, “In entering into a mutual
assurance, you have wished to purchase freedom from anxiety,
and the indeterminate quota which you reserve annually to cover
accidents is the price which you pay for this immunity. But if
you do not know what this price is beforehand, your tranquillity is
never perfect. I now propose to you, therefore, another expedient.
In consideration of a <em class="e000I2">fixed annual premium</em> which you shall pay
me, I take upon myself all your chances of accidents. I will
insure you all, and here is the capital which will guarantee the
fulfilment of my engagement.”</p>

<p>The proprietors accept the proposal, even although this fixed
premium should amount to somewhat more than the sum which
their mutual assurance cost them; for their object is not so much
to save a few shillings as to obtain perfect repose and freedom
from anxiety.</p>

<p>At this point the Socialists pretend that the principle of
association is destroyed. For my part, I think it is improved,
and on the road to other improvements to which I can see no
limits.</p>

<p>But, say the Socialists, the assured have no longer any mutual
tie. They no longer see each other and come to a common understanding.
Intermediary parasites have come among them, and the
proof that the proprietors are now paying more than is required to
cover accidents is to be found in the fact, that the insurers obtain
large profits.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to answer this objection.</p>

<p>First of all, association exists, but under another form. The
premium contributed by the assured is still the fund which is to
make good the losses. The assured have found the means of
remaining in the association without taking part in its business.
This is evidently an advantage to each of them, seeing that the
design they have in view is nevertheless attained; and the
possibility of remaining in the association whilst they have their
<a id="p356" class="xxpn">[p356]</a> independence of movement and free use of their faculties restored
to them, is just the characteristic of social progress.</p>

<p>As regards the profit obtained by the intermediate party, it is
easily explained and justified. The assured remain associated for
the purpose of repairing accidents and making good what is lost.
But a company has stepped in which offers them the following
advantages: 1<em class="e000I2">st</em>, It takes away whatever of uncertainty remained
in the position of the assured; 2<em class="e000I2">dly</em>, It frees them from all care and
trouble in connexion with accidents. These are <em class="e000I2">services</em>, and the
rule is, service for service. The proof that the intervention of the
company is a service possessed of value is to be found in the fact
that it is freely accepted and paid for. The Socialists only make
themselves ridiculous when they declaim against such middlemen.
Do they intrude themselves into commercial transactions by force?
Have they any other means of introducing themselves and their
services than by saying to the parties with whom they deal, “I
will cost you some trouble, but I will save you more?” How,
then, can they be called parasites or even intermediaries?</p>

<p>I affirm, moreover, that association thus transformed is on the
direct road of progress in every sense.</p>

<p>In fact, companies which expect to realize profits proportioned
to the extent of their business, promote insurances. To aid them
in this they have agents in all quarters, they establish credits, they
devise a thousand combinations to increase the number of the
assured—in other words, of the <em class="e000I2">associated</em> parties. They undertake
a multitude of risks which were unknown to the primitive mutual
insurance associations. In short, association is extended progressively
to a greater number of men and things. In proportion as
this development takes place, the companies find they can lower
their prices; they are even forced by competition to do so. And
here we again get a glimpse of the great law, that profit soon
escapes from the hands of the producer to settle in those of the
consumer.</p>

<p>Nor is this all: companies insure each other by reassurances,
so that, with a view to providing for losses, which is the principal
object in view, a thousand associations scattered over England,
France, Germany, and America, are melted into one grand and
unique association. And what is the result? If a house is burnt
down at Bordeaux, Paris, or elsewhere, the proprietors of the
whole world, English, Belgians, Germans, Spaniards, club together
and repair the disaster.</p>

<p>This is an example of the degree of power, universality, and
perfection, which may be reached by means of free and voluntary
<a id="p357" class="xxpn">[p357]</a> association. But to attain this they must be left free to manage
their own business. Now, what happened when the Socialists,
those great partisans of association, were in power? Their chief
business was to threaten association in every form, and principally
association for insurance. And why? Just because, in order to
render itself more universal, it adopted those expedients which
left each of its members in a state of independence. How little
these unfortunate Socialists understand the social mechanism!
They would bring us back to the rude and primitive forms which
association assumed when society was in its infancy, and they
would suppress all progress under the pretext that it has departed
from these forms.</p>

<p>We shall see, by-and-by, that from the same prejudices, the
same ignorance, arise their incessant declamations against <em class="e000I2">interest</em>.
The <em class="e000I2">interest</em> and <em class="e000I2">wages</em> are <em class="e000I2">fixed</em>, and, consequently, improved forms
of remuneration for the use of labour and capital.</p>

<p>The wages-system [<em class="e000I2">salariat</em>] has been peculiarly the butt of the
Socialists. They have almost gone the length of representing it as
a modified, and not greatly modified, system of slavery and thraldom.
At all events, they see in it only a bargain which is one-sided
and leonine, founded on liberty merely in appearance, an
oppression of the weak by the strong, or the tyranny of capital
over labour.</p>

<p>Continually wrangling about new institutions to be founded, the
Socialists display in their common hatred of existing institutions,
and especially of the system of remuneration by wages, a striking
unanimity. If they cannot attain unity as to the new social
organization to be established, they are at least marvellously
united in calumniating, decrying, running down, hating, and
making hated, everything which actually exists. I have assigned
the reason for this elsewhere.<a
href="#FN_76" id="FNa_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>Much unfortunately takes place which is beyond the domain of
philosophical discussion; and the Socialist propaganda, seconded
by an ignorant and cowardly press, which, without avowing Socialism,
seeks for popularity in fashionable declamations, has succeeded
in instilling hatred of the wages-system into the minds of
the very people who live by wages. Workmen have become disgusted
with this form of remuneration. It appears to them unjust,
humiliating, and odious. They think it brands them with the
mark of servitude. They desire to participate on another principle
in the distribution of wealth. Hence they have fallen passionately
in love with the most extravagant Utopias. They had but one
<a id="p358" class="xxpn">[p358]</a> step to take, and they have taken it. When the revolution of
February broke out, the grand object of the working classes was
to get rid of wages. Upon the means of accomplishing this they
consulted their oracles; but when these oracles did not remain
mute, they followed the usual mode by giving obscure utterances,
in which the word which predominated was <em class="e000I2">association</em>, as if
<em class="e000I2">association</em> and <em class="e000I2">wages</em> were incompatible. Then the workmen
would try all the forms of this liberty-giving association; and, to
impart to it greater attraction, they were pleased to invest it
with all the charms of Solidarity, and attributed to it all the
merits of Fraternity. For the moment, one would have been led
to believe that the human heart itself had been about to undergo
a grand transformation, and to throw off the yoke of self-interest,
in order to give place to the principle of sympathy. By a singular
contradiction, they hoped from association to reap at once all the
glory of self-sacrifice, and material profits of hitherto unheard-of
amount. They fell down before the statue of Fortune, prayed,
and decreed to themselves the glory of martyrdom. It seemed as
if these workmen, thus misled, and on the point of being seduced
into a career of injustice, felt it necessary to shut their eyes to
their true position, to glorify the methods of spoliation which had
been taught them by their apostles, and place them covered with
a veil in the sanctuary of a new revelation. Never, perhaps, had
so many and such dangerous errors, so many and such gross contradictions,
found their way before into the human brain.</p>

<p>Let us inquire, then, what wages really are, and consider their
origin, form, and effects. Let us trace the subject to its foundation,
and make sure whether, in the development of humanity,
wages constitute retrogression or progress—whether in receiving
wages there be anything humiliating or degrading, or which can
in any degree be allied with slavery.</p>

<p>Services are exchanged for services, labour, efforts, pains, cares,
natural or acquired ability,—these are what we give and receive.
What we confer on one another is satisfaction or enjoyment.
What determines the exchange is the common advantage, and its
measure is the free appreciation of reciprocal services. The
various combinations to which human transactions give rise have
necessitated a voluminous economic vocabulary; but the words,
Profits, Interest, Wages, although indicating shades of difference,
do not change the nature and foundation of things. We have
still the <em class="e000I2">do ut des</em>, or rather the <em class="e000I2">facio ut facias</em>, which constitutes
the basis of the whole economic evolution.<a
href="#FN_77" id="FNa_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> <a id="p359" class="xxpn">[p359]</a></p>

<p>The class which lives by wages forms no exception to this law.
Examine the subject attentively. Do these men render services?
Unquestionably they do. Are services rendered to them? Undoubtedly
they are. Are these services exchanged freely and
voluntarily? Do we perceive in this kind of transaction any appearance
of fraud or violence? It is at this point, perhaps, that
the grievances of the workman begin. They don’t go the length
of pretending that they are deprived of their liberty, but they
assert that this liberty is merely nominal and a mockery, because
the man whose necessities force the determination is not really
free. It remains for us to inquire, then, whether the defect of
liberty thus understood does not belong to the situation of the
workman rather than to the mode of his remuneration.</p>

<p>When one man enters into the service of another, his remuneration
may consist in a part of the work produced, or in a determinate
wage. In either case he must bargain for this part of the
product—for it may be greater or less,—or for this wage—for it
may be higher or lower. If the man is in a state of absolute
destitution, if he cannot wait, if he acts on the spur of urgent
necessity, he must submit, and cannot get rid of the other’s exactions.
But you will observe that it is not the form of remuneration
which gives rise to this dependence. Whether he runs the
risk of the enterprise by stipulating for a share of the product, or
bargains for a fixed remuneration whether the other gain or lose,
it is his precarious situation which gives him an inferior position
in the discussion which precedes the arrangement. Those innovators
who have represented association to the working classes as
an infallible remedy have misled them, and are themselves mistaken.
They can convince themselves of this by observing
attentively the circumstances in cases where the indigent workman
receives part of the product in place of wages. There are
assuredly no men in the country worse off than fishermen or vine-dressers,
although they have the satisfaction of enjoying all the
benefits which the Socialists denominate, exclusively, <em class="e000I2">association</em>.</p>

<p>But before proceeding to inquire into the circumstances which
influence the quota of wages, I must define, or rather describe, the
nature of the transaction.</p>

<p>Men have a tendency—which is natural, and, therefore, advantageous,
moral, universal, indestructible—to desire security with
reference to the means of subsistence, to seek fixity, and avoid
uncertainty.</p>

<p>However, in the early stages of society uncertainty reigns
supreme, and it has frequently astonished me that Political
<a id="p360" class="xxpn">[p360]</a> Economy has failed to mark the great and happy efforts which
have been made to restrain this uncertainty within narrower and
narrower limits.</p>

<p>Take the case of a tribe of hunters, or a nomad people, or a
colony newly founded,—is there a single man who can say with
certainty what to-morrow’s labour will be worth? Would there
not even seem to be an incompatibility between the two ideas,
and that nothing can be of a more causal nature than the result
of labour, whether applied to the chase, to fishing, or to agriculture?</p>

<p>It will be difficult, then, to find, in an infant society, anything
which resembles stipends, salaries, wages, revenues, rents, interest,
assurance, etc., which are all things which have been invented in
order to give more and more fixity to personal situations, to get
quit, to a greater and greater degree, of that feeling so painful to
men of uncertainty with reference to the means of subsistence.</p>

<p>The progress which has been made in this direction is indeed
admirable, although custom has so familiarized us with this phenomenon
that we fail to attend to it. In fact, since the results of
labour, and consequently the enjoyments of mankind, may be so
profoundly modified by events, by unforeseen circumstances, by
the caprices of nature, the uncertainty of the seasons, and accidents
of every kind, we may ask how it comes to pass that so
great a number of men find themselves set free for a time, and
some of them for life, by means of rents, salaries, and retiring
pensions, from this species of <em class="e000I2">eventuality</em>, of uncertainty, which
would seem to be essentially part of our nature.</p>

<p>The efficient cause, the motive power of this beautiful evolution
of the human race, is the tendency of all men towards competency
and material prosperity, of which Fixity is so essential a part.
The means consist in the substitution of a fixed unconditional bargain
for one dependent merely on appreciable chances, or the
gradual abandonment of that primitive form of association which
consists in committing all the parties concerned irrevocably to all
the risks and chances of the enterprise; in other words, the improvement
of association. It is singular, at least, that all our great
modern reformers exhibit association to us as destroyed by the
very element which improves and perfects it.</p>

<p>In order that men should consent to take upon themselves, unconditionally,
risks which fall naturally on others, it is necessary
that a species of knowledge, which I have called <em class="e000I2">experimental
statistics</em>, should have made some progress; for experience alone
can place them in a situation to appreciate these risks, at least
<a id="p361" class="xxpn">[p361]</a> approximately, and consequently to appreciate the <em class="e000I2">value of the service</em>
rendered in securing them against such risks. This is the
reason why the bargains and transactions of rude and ignorant
nations admit no stipulations of this nature, and hence, as I have
said, uncertainty exercises over such people uncontrolled power.
Were a savage, grown old, and having laid up some stock of game,
to take a young hunter into his service, he would not give him
fixed wages, but a share in the produce of the chase. How, indeed,
could either of them, from the known infer the unknown?
The teachings of past experience do not permit them to insure the
future beforehand.</p>

<p>In times of barbarism and inexperience, men, no doubt, <em class="e000I2">associate</em>,
for we have demonstrated that otherwise they could not exist;
but association can assume among them only that primitive and
elementary form which the Socialists represent as the only one
which can secure our future safety.</p>

<p>When two men have long worked on together, encountering
equal risks, there at length comes a time when, from experience,
they can estimate and appreciate the value of these risks, and one
of them consents to take the entire risk upon his own shoulders,
in consideration of a fixed recompense.</p>

<p>This arrangement is undoubtedly a step of progress, and it is
shown to be so by the very fact that it has been effected freely and
voluntarily by the two parties, who would not have entered into
it had it not been felt to be for their mutual benefit. It is easy to
see in what the benefit consists. The one party gains by obtaining
the exclusive management of an undertaking of which he takes all
the risks upon himself; the other by obtaining that fixity of position
which is so much desired. And society at large must be
benefited by having an enterprise, formerly subjected to two minds
and two wills, henceforth conducted with unity of views and unity
of action.</p>

<p>But although association is modified in this way, it by no means
follows that it is dissolved. The co-operation of the two men is
continued, although the mode of dividing the product of their
enterprise has been changed. Association is not vitiated by an
innovation voluntarily agreed to, and which satisfies all parties.</p>

<p>The co-operation of anterior labour and present labour is always,
or almost always, required in order to realize new means of satisfaction
and enjoyment. Capital and labour, in uniting in a common
undertaking, are, in the first instance, forced to undertake each its
share of the risk; and this continues until the value of the risk
can be experimentally estimated. Then two tendencies, which are
<a id="p362" class="xxpn">[p362]</a> alike natural to the human heart, manifest themselves—I mean the
tendencies towards <em class="e000I2">unity of direction</em> and <em class="e000I2">fixity of situation</em>. Capital
then says to labour: “Experience has taught us that your eventual
profit amounts, on an average, to so much. If you wish it, I will
ensure you this amount, and take charge of the operation, taking
upon myself the chances of profit or loss.”</p>

<p>Labour may possibly answer: “This proposal suits me very well.
Sometimes I earned twenty pounds a year; sometimes I earn sixty.
These fluctuations are very inconvenient, for they hinder me from
regulating uniformly my own expenditure and that of my family.
It is an advantage to me to get rid of this uncertainty, and to
receive a fixed recompense of forty pounds.”</p>

<p>By this arrangement the terms of the contract will be changed.
They will continue to <em class="e000I2">unite their efforts</em>, and to <em class="e000I2">share the proceeds</em>,
and consequently the association will not be dissolved; but it will
be modified in this way, that the capitalist will take all the risks
with the compensation of all the extraordinary profits, whilst the
labourer will be secured the advantages of fixity. Such is the origin
of Wages.</p>

<p>The agreement may take place in the reverse way. Frequently
the person who undertakes a commercial enterprise says to the
capitalist: “Hitherto we have worked together, sharing the risks.
Now that we are in a situation to appreciate these risks, I propose
to make a fixed bargain. You have invested a thousand pounds
in the undertaking, for which one year you receive twenty-five
pounds, another year seventy-five. If you agree to it, I will give
you fifty pounds, or 5 per cent. per annum, and free you from all
risk, on condition that I have henceforth the entire management
of the concern.”</p>

<p>The capitalist will probably answer: “Since, with great and
troublesome fluctuations, I receive, on an average, only fifty pounds
per annum, I should much prefer to have that sum regularly
assured to me. I shall, therefore, allow my capital to remain in
the concern, but I am to be exempted from all risk. My activity
and intelligence will now be free to engage in some other undertaking.”</p>

<p>This is an advantage in a social, as well as an individual point
of view.</p>

<p>We see that men are constantly in quest of a fixed and stable
position, and that there is an incessant effort to diminish and circumscribe
on all sides the element of uncertainty. Where two
men participate in a common risk, this risk, having a substantive
existence, cannot be annihilated; but the tendency is for one of
<a id="p363" class="xxpn">[p363]</a> them to take that risk upon himself. If the capitalist undertakes
the risk, the labourer’s remuneration is fixed under the name of
<em class="e000I2">wages</em>. If the labourer runs the chances of profit or loss, then
the remuneration of the capitalist is fixed under the name of
<em class="e000I2">interest</em>.</p>

<p>And as capital is nothing else than human services, we may say
that <em class="e000I2">capital</em> and <em class="e000I2">labour</em> are two words which in reality express one
and the same idea; and, consequently, the same thing may be said
of <em class="e000I2">interest</em> and <em class="e000I2">wages</em>. Thus, where false science never fails to find
antagonism, true science ever finds identity.</p>

<p>Considered, then, with reference to their origin, nature, and form,
<em class="e000I2">wages</em> have in them nothing degrading or humiliating any more
than <em class="e000I2">interest</em> has. Both constitute the return for present and anterior
labour derived from the results of a common enterprise.
Only it almost always happens that one of the two associates agrees
to take upon himself the risk. If it be the present labour which
claims a uniform remuneration, the chances of profit are given up
in consideration of wages. If it be the anterior labour which
claims a fixed return, the capitalist gives up his eventual chance of
profits for a determinate rate of <em class="e000I2">interest</em>.</p>

<p>For my own part, I am convinced that this new stipulation which
is ingrafted on the primitive form of association, far from destroying
it, improves and perfects it. I have no doubt of this, when I consider
that such a stipulation takes its rise from a felt want, from
the natural desire of all men for stability; and, moreover, that it
satisfies all parties, without injury, but, on the contrary, by serving
the interests of the public.</p>

<p>Modern reformers, who, under pretence of having invented association,
desire to bring it back to its primitive and rudimentary
forms, ought to tell us in what respect these <em class="e000I2">fixed bargains</em> are
opposed to justice or equity, in what respect they are prejudicial
to progress, and on what principle they wish to interdict them.
They ought also to tell us why, if such stipulations bear the stamp
of barbarism, they are constantly and more and more mixed up
with that association which is represented as the perfection of
human society.</p>

<p>In my opinion, such stipulations are among the most marvellous
manifestations, as they are among the most powerful springs, of
progress. They are at once the perfection and reward of a past
and very ancient civilisation, and the starting-point of a new and
unlimited career of future civilisation. Had society adhered to
that primitive form of association which saddles all the parties
interested with a share of the risks of an enterprise, ninety-nine
<a id="p364" class="xxpn">[p364]</a> out of every hundred of such enterprises never would have been
undertaken. The man who at the present day participates in a
score of enterprises would have been tied down for ever to one.
Unity of design and of will would have been wanting in all commercial
operations; and mankind would never have tasted that
precious good which is perhaps the source of genius—stability.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">wages-system</em> [<em class="e000I2">salariat</em>], then, takes its rise in a natural and
indestructible tendency. Observe, however, that it satisfies men’s
desires but imperfectly. It renders the remuneration of workmen
more uniform, more equal, and brings it nearer to an average; but
there is one thing which it cannot do, and which their admission
to a participation in profits and risks could not accomplish, namely,
to ensure them employment.</p>

<p>And here I cannot help remarking how powerful the feeling is to
which I have made reference throughout the whole of this chapter,
and the very existence of which our modern reformers do not seem
even to suspect,—I mean men’s aversion to uncertainty. It is
exactly this very feeling which has made it so easy for Socialist
declaimers to create such a hatred on the part of the working
classes to receive their remuneration in the shape of wages.</p>

<p>We can conceive three phases in the condition of the labourer:
the predominance of uncertainty; the predominance of stability;
and an intermediate state, from which uncertainty is partly
excluded, but not sufficiently so to give place to fixity and
stability.</p>

<p>What the working classes do not sufficiently understand is, that
the association which the Socialists preach up to them is the
infancy of society, the period when men are groping their way,
the time of quick transitions and fluctuations, of alternations of
plethora and atrophy—in a word, the period when absolute uncertainty
reigns supreme. The wages-system, on the contrary,
forms the intermediate link between uncertainty and fixity.</p>

<p>Now, the working classes, being far as yet from feeling themselves
in a state of stability, place their hopes—like all men ill at
ease—on a certain change of position. This is the reason why it
has been an easy task for Socialism to impose upon them by the
use of the grand term <em class="e000I2">association</em>. The working classes fancy
themselves pushed forward when they are in reality falling behind.</p>

<p>Yes, these unfortunate people are falling back to the primitive
and rudimentary stage of the social movement; for what is the
association now so loudly preached up to them but the subjection
of all to all risks and contingencies? This is inevitable in times
of ignorance, since fixed bargains presuppose some progress at
<a id="p365" class="xxpn">[p365]</a> least in experimental statistics. But the doctrine now inculcated
is nothing else than a pure and simple revival of the reign of uncertainty.</p>

<p>The workmen who were enthusiasts for association when they
knew it only in theory, were enchanted when the revolution of
February seemed to render possible its practical adoption.</p>

<p>At that period many employers of labour, either infected with
the universal infatuation, or giving way to their fears, offered to
substitute a participation in the returns for payment by wages.
But the workmen did not much fancy this solidarity of risk. They
understood very well what was offered them; for in case the
enterprise turned out a losing concern, they would have had no
remuneration of any kind,—which to them was death.</p>

<p>We saw then what would not have been to the credit of our
working classes, had the blame not lain with the pretended
reformers, in whom, unhappily, they placed confidence. The
working classes demanded a sort of bastard association in which
the rate of wages was to be maintained, and in which they were
to be entitled to a share of the profits without being subject to
any of the losses.</p>

<p>The workmen would probably never of themselves have thought
of putting forward such pretensions. There is in human nature a
fund of good sense and a feeling of justice to which such barefaced
iniquity is repugnant. To corrupt man’s heart, you must
begin by depraving his intellect.</p>

<p>This is what the leaders of the Socialist school did not fail to
do; and with this fact before us I am frequently asked whether
their intentions were not perverse. I am always inclined to
respect men’s motives; but it is exceedingly difficult, under such
circumstances, to exculpate the Socialist chiefs.</p>

<p>After having, by the unjust and persevering declamations with
which their books are filled, irritated the working classes against
their employers, after having persuaded them that they were in a
state of war, in which everything is fair against the enemy, they
enveloped the ultimatum of the workmen in scientific subtleties,
and even in clouds of mysticism. They figured an abstract being
called Society, which owed to each of its members a <em class="e000I2">minimum</em>,
that is to say, an assured means of subsistence. “You have, then,
a right,” they told the workmen, “to demand a fixed wage.” In
this way they began by satisfying the natural desire of men for
stability. Then they proceeded to teach them that, independently
of wages, the workmen should have a share in the profits; and
when asked whether he was also to bear his share of the losses,
<a id="p366" class="xxpn">[p366]</a> their answer was, that in virtue of State intervention and the
guarantee of the taxpayer, they had invented a system of universal
industry, protected from all loss. By this means they
removed all the remaining scruples of the unfortunate workmen;
and when the revolution of February broke out we saw them, as
I have said, disposed to make three stipulations:—</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p>1<em class="e000I2">st</em>, Continuance of wages;</p>
<p>2<em class="e000I2">d</em>, Participation in profits;</p>
<p>3<em class="e000I2">d</em>, Immunity from losses.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It may be said, perhaps, that these stipulations were neither so
unjust nor so impossible as they appeared, seeing that they are
introduced in many enterprises, having reference to newspapers,
railways, etc.</p>

<p>I answer that there is something truly puerile in allowing oneself
to be duped by high-sounding names applied to very trivial
things. A little candour will at once convince us that this participation
in profits, which some concerns allow to their workmen
receiving wages, does not constitute association, nor merit that
title, nor is it a great revolution introduced into the relations of
two classes of society. It is only an ingenious and useful encouragement
given to workmen receiving wages, under a form
which is not exactly new, although it has been represented as an
adhesion to Socialism. Employers who, in adopting this custom,
devote a tenth, a twentieth, or a hundredth part of their profits,
when they have any, to this <em class="e000I2">largesse</em> bestowed on their workmen,
may make a great noise about it, and proclaim themselves the
generous renovators of the social order; but it is really unworthy
of occupying more of our time at present, and I return to
my argument.</p>

<p>The system of payment by wages, then, was a step of progress.
In the first instance, anterior labour and present labour were
associated together with common risks, in common enterprises,
the circle of which, in such circumstances, must have been very
limited. If society had not discovered other combinations, no
important work could ever have been undertaken. Men would
have remained hunters and fishers, and there might have been
perhaps some rude attempts at agriculture.</p>

<p>Afterwards, in obedience to the double feeling which prompts
us to seek stability, and, at the same time, retain the direction of
those operations of which we must encounter the risks, the two
associates, without putting an end to the association, seek to
supersede the joint hazard by a fixed bargain, and agree that one
of them should give the other a fixed remuneration, and take
<a id="p367" class="xxpn">[p367]</a> upon himself the whole risk, along with the exclusive direction of
the enterprise. When this fixity applies to the anterior labour,
or capital, it is called <em class="e000I2">interest</em>; when it applies to the present
labour, it is called <em class="e000I2">wages</em>.</p>

<p>But, as I have already said, wages serve only imperfectly to
constitute a state of stability for a certain class of men, or of
security in regard to the means of subsistence. It is one step, and
a very marked one, towards the realization of this benefit, and so
difficult that at first sight we should have thought it impossible;
but it does not effect its entire realization.</p>

<p>And it is perhaps worthy of remark in passing, that fixity of
situation, stability, resembles in one respect all the great results
of which mankind are in pursuit. We are always approximating
to such results, but we never fully attain them. For the very
reason that stability is a good, a benefit, we must always be
making efforts more and more to extend its domain; but it is not
in our nature ever to obtain complete possession of it. We may
even go the length of saying that to obtain such possession would
not be desirable for man in his present state. Absolute good of
whatever kind would put an end to all desire, all effort, all combination,
all thought, all foresight, all virtue. Perfection excludes
the notion of perfectibility.</p>

<p>The working classes having then, with the lapse of time and the
progress of civilisation, reached the improved system of payment
by wages, have not stopped short at that point, or relaxed their
efforts to realize stability.</p>

<p>No doubt wages come in with certainty at the conclusion of the
day’s work; but when circumstances—as, for example, an industrial
crisis, or a protracted illness—have interrupted work, the wages
are interrupted also. What, then, is the workman to do? Are
he and his wife and children to be deprived of food?</p>

<p>He has but one resource, and that is, to save, while employed,
the means of supplying his wants in sickness and old age.</p>

<p>But, in the individual case, who can estimate beforehand the
comparative length of time in which he has to assist, or be
assisted?</p>

<p>What cannot be done in the individual case may be found more
practicable with reference to the masses in virtue of <em class="e000I2">the law of
averages</em>. The tribute paid by the workman while employed to
provide for his support in periods of stoppage answers the purpose
much more effectually, and with much more irregularity and certainty,
when it is centralized by association, than when it is
abandoned to individual chances. <a id="p368" class="xxpn">[p368]</a></p>

<p>Hence the origin of <em class="e000I2">Friendly Societies</em>—admirable institutions
which benevolence had given birth to long before the name of
Socialism was ever heard of. It would be difficult to say who was
their inventor. The true inventor, I believe, was the felt want of
some such institutions—the desire of men for something fixed, the
restless active instinct which leads us to remove the obstacles
which mankind encounter in their progress towards stability.</p>

<p>I have myself seen friendly societies rise up spontaneously,
more than five-and-twenty years ago, among the most destitute
labourers and artisans of the poorest villages in the department of
the Landes.</p>

<p>The obvious design of these societies is to equalize enjoyments,
and to spread and distribute over all periods of life the wages
earned in days of health and prosperity. In all localities in which
they exist, these societies have conferred immense benefits. The
contributors are sustained by a feeling of security, a feeling the
most precious and consolatory which can enter the heart of man
in his pilgrimage here below. Moreover, they feel their reciprocal
dependence and their usefulness to each other. They see at what
point the prosperity or adversity of each individual, or of each
profession, becomes the prosperity or adversity of all.</p>

<p>They meet together on certain occasions for religious worship,
as provided by their rules; and then they are called to exercise
over each other that vigilant surveillance so proper to inspire
self-respect, which is the first and most difficult step in the march
of civilisation.</p>

<p>What has hitherto ensured the success of these societies,—a
success which has been slow, indeed, like everything which concerns
the masses,—is liberty: of this there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>The natural danger which they encounter is the removal of the
sense of responsibility. It is never without creating great dangers
and great difficulties for the future, that we set an individual free
from the consequences of his own acts.<a
href="#FN_78" id="FNa_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p>Were all our citizens to say, “We will club together to assist
those who cannot work, or who cannot find employment,” we
should fear to see developed to a dangerous extent man’s natural
tendency to idleness; we should fear that the laborious would
soon become the dupes of the slothful. Mutual assistance, then,
implies mutual surveillance, without which the common fund
would soon be exhausted. This reciprocal surveillance is for such
association a necessary guarantee of existence—a security for each
contributor that he shall not be made to play the part of dupe;
<a id="p369" class="xxpn">[p369]</a> and it constitutes besides the true morality of the institution. By
this means we see drunkenness and debauchery gradually disappear;
for what right could that man have to assistance from
the common fund who has brought disease and want of employment
upon himself by his own vicious habits? It is this
surveillance which re-establishes that responsibility which the
association might otherwise tend to enfeeble.</p>

<p>Now, in order that this surveillance should operate beneficially,
friendly societies must be free and select, and have the control of
their own rules, as well as of their own funds. It is necessary
also that they should be able to suit their rules to the requirements
of each locality.</p>

<p>Suppose Government to interfere, it is easy to see the part
which it would play. Its first business would be to lay hold of
all these funds, under the pretence of centralizing them; and
to give a colour to the proceeding, it would promise to enlarge
the funds from resources taken from the taxpayer. “Is it not,”
it would be said, “very natural and very just that the State
should contribute to so great, so generous, so philanthropic, so
humane a work?” This is the first injustice—to introduce the
element of force into the society, and, along with the contributions,
to obtrude citizens who have no right to a share of the
fund. And then, under pretence of unity, of solidarity, the State
would set itself to fuse all these associations into one, subject to
the same rules.</p>

<p>But, I would ask, what will become of the morality of the
institution when its funds are augmented by taxation; when no
one except a Government official has an interest to defend the
common stock; when every one, instead of feeling it his duty to
prevent abuses, will take pleasure in favouring them; when all
mutual surveillance has ceased; and when to feign disease would
only be to play off a good trick on the Government? The
Government, to do it justice, is well disposed to defend itself; but
being no longer able to avail itself of private action, it must necessarily
substitute official action. It will name examiners, controllers,
inspectors. Countless formalities will be interposed between
want and assistance. In short, what was originally an admirable
institution will be transformed into a mere department of police.</p>

<p>The State will, in the first instance, perceive only the advantage
of swelling the mob of its creatures, of multiplying the places
at its disposal, and of extending its patronage and electioneering
influence. It will not remark that in arrogating to itself a new
function, it has assumed a new responsibility,—a responsibility
<a id="p370" class="xxpn">[p370]</a> which I venture to designate as fearful. For what must the immediate
consequence be? The working classes will no longer
regard the common fund as a property which they administer
and keep up, and the limits of which are the limits of their
rights. They will soon accustom themselves to regard assistance
in cases of sickness or want of employment, not as proceeding
from a limited fund prepared by their own foresight,
but as a debt due to them by society. Its resources will appear to
them unbounded, and they will never be contented with their
share. The State will find itself under the necessity of demanding
constant additions to the budget. Encountering opposition in
that, the Government will find itself involved in inextricable
difficulties. Abuses will go on increasing, which, year after
year, they will shrink from reforming, until an explosion comes
at last. And then it will be found that we have to deal with a
population which can no longer act for itself, which expects
everything from a minister or a prefect, even subsistence, and
whose ideas are so far perverted as to have lost all rational
notions of Right, Property, Liberty, or Justice.</p>

<p>Such are some of the reasons which alarmed me, I confess, when
I saw lately that a Commission of the Legislative Assembly had
been charged to prepare a project of law on friendly societies. It
struck me that the hour of their destruction was approaching, and
it afflicted me the more that I had thought a great future was in
store for them, could we only preserve them in the bracing air of
liberty. Is it then, I would ask, so very difficult a thing to leave
men to make a trial, to feel their way, to make a choice, to find
themselves mistaken, to rectify their mistakes, to inform themselves,
to act in concert, to manage their own property and their
own interests, to act for themselves on their own proper risk and
peril, and on their own responsibility? Is it not evident that
this is the way to make them really men? Shall we never
cease to begin with the fatal hypothesis that all governors are
guardians, and the governed only children?</p>

<p>I maintain that, left to the vigilance of the parties interested,
our Friendly Societies have before them a great future, and I
require no other proof of this than what has taken place on
the other side of the Channel.</p>

<p>“In England, individual foresight has not waited for Government
impulse to organize a powerful and reciprocal association
between the working classes. For a long period, <em class="e000I2">free</em> associations,
administering their own affairs, have been founded in all the principal
towns of Great Britain,” etc.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. <a id="p371" class="xxpn">[p371]</a></p>

<p>“The total number of these associations for the United Kingdom
amounts to 33,223, including not less than 3,052,000 individuals—one-half
of the adult population of Great Britain.”&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>“This great confederation of the working classes, this institution
of effective and practical fraternity, rests on the most
solid basis. Their revenue is five millions sterling, and their
accumulated capital amounts to eleven millions and two hundred
thousand pounds.”</p>

<p>“It is upon this fund that the contributors draw when out of
employment. We are astonished to see how England rallies from
the immense and profound perturbations which her gigantic industry
experiences from time to time, and almost periodically—and
the explanation of the phenomenon is to a great extent to be
found in the facts now stated.”</p>

<p>“Mr Roebuck wished, on account of the great importance of
the question, that the Government <em class="e000I2">would assume the initiative</em> by
taking the question into its own hands. . .&#160;. This was opposed
by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.”</p>

<p>“Where individual interests are sufficient for their own free
government, power, in England, judges it useless to interpose its
action. It watches from above to see that all goes on regularly;
but it leaves to every man the merit of his exertions, and the care
of administering his affairs, according to his own notions and convenience.
It is to this independence of her citizens that England
assuredly owes a portion of her greatness as a nation.”<a
href="#FN_79" id="FNa_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>It might have been added that it is to that independence also
that the citizens owe their experience and personal worth. To
that independence, too, the English Government owes its relative
freedom from responsibility, and consequently its stability.</p>

<p>Among the institutions which may take their rise from Friendly
Societies, when they shall have made that advance which has
scarcely yet been begun, I should give the first place, on account
of their social importance, to the labourer’s <em class="e000I2">Caisse de Retraite</em>.<a
href="#FN_80" id="FNa_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p>There are persons who treat such an institution as a chimera.
Such people, no doubt, pretend to be acquainted with the extreme
limits as regards Stability, beyond which the human race is not
permitted to go. I would ask them a few simple questions: If
they had never known anything beyond the social state of those
barbarous tribes who live by hunting and fishing, would they have
been able to anticipate the existence, I do not say of our present
<a id="p372" class="xxpn">[p372]</a> land revenues, of Government funds, and fixed salaries, but even
of the system of payment by wages, which is the first step towards
fixity in the condition of the poorest classes? And then, if they
had never seen anything beyond this wages-system, as it exists in
countries which have not yet displayed the spirit of association,
would they have ventured to predict the destinies reserved for
<em class="e000I2">Friendly Societies</em> as we find them at work in our own day in
England? Do they imagine that these first steps of progress
were more easy than it is for us to establish <em class="e000I2">Caisses de Retraite</em>?
Is this third step more difficult to take than the other two?</p>

<p>For myself, I see clearly that mankind thirsts after stability. I
see them, century after century, adding to their incomplete conquests,
for the benefit of one class or another, and this by marvellous
processes, which would seem to be much above individual
invention, and I confess that I dare not venture to predict at what
point men will stop short on the road of progress.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, that these <em class="e000I2">Caisses de Retraite</em> are universally,
unanimously, ardently desired by all our workmen; and
very naturally so.</p>

<p>I have frequently interrogated them, and I have always found
that the great pain and grief of their existence is not the severity
of their work, nor the smallness of their wages, nor even the irritation
which the spectacle of inequality is calculated to excite. No,
what affects them, discourages them, pains them, tortures them, is
their uncertainty as regards the future. Whatever profession we
may belong to, whether we are public functionaries, or men of
independent fortune, or landed proprietors, or merchants, physicians,
lawyers, soldiers, magistrates, we enjoy without perceiving
it, consequently without acknowledging it, the progress which has
been realized by Society—so that we cannot comprehend the torture
of uncertainty. Let us place ourselves, then, in the situation of
a workman, of an artisan who, on getting up every morning, is
haunted by such thoughts as these: “I am young and robust; I
work on, and sometimes harder than my neighbours, and have less
leisure than they. And yet I have difficulty in providing for the
modest wants of myself and of my wife and children. But what
will become of me, what will become of them, when old age or
disease shall have palsied my arm? To provide for those days of
helplessness by saving from my wages would require self-control
and prudence almost superhuman. Yet in spite of sickness, I have
the prospect of enjoying happiness by means of a Friendly Society.
Old age, however, is not an eventuality; it will come inevitably
and without fail. Every day I feel its approach; it will soon
<a id="p373" class="xxpn">[p373]</a> overtake me; and then, after a life of honest labour, what prospect
have I before me? For myself the garret, the hospital, or the jail;
fur my wife, beggary; for my daughter, worse still. Oh, for some
social institution which would compel me even by force, while still
young, to secure a provision for old age!”</p>

<p>Such are the thoughts, feebly as I have expressed them, which
every day, and every night, and every hour, haunt the terror-stricken
imaginations of vast numbers of our fellow-men. And
when a problem presents itself under such conditions, you may be
very sure that it is not insoluble.</p>

<p>If in their efforts to impart more stability to their future, the
working classes have disseminated alarm among the other classes
of society, it has arisen from their having given to these efforts a
false, dangerous, and unjust direction. Their first idea, according
to French custom, has been to attack the treasury; to found the
<em class="e000I2">Caisses de Retraite</em> on the contributions of the taxpayer, and to
bring into play the State and the Law, that is to say, to secure all
the profits of spoliation without incurring the dangers, or bearing
the shame of it.</p>

<p>It is not from this quarter of the social horizon that the institutions
so much desired by the working classes may be expected to
come. The <em class="e000I2">Caisse de Retraite</em>, in order that its origin may be in
keeping with its end and design, and to ensure its being useful,
solid, and respectable, must proceed from the working classes
themselves, must be the fruit of their exertions, their energy, their
sagacity, their experience, their foresight. It must be supported
by their contributions, and fed and nourished by their sacrifices.
All they have to ask from Government is liberty of action and
repression of fraud.</p>

<p>But has the time come when a <em class="e000I2">Caisse de Retraite</em> for the working
classes is possible? I think it has. In order that an institution
which brings new stability to the interests of a class should be
established, a certain amount of anterior progress is necessary. It
is necessary that a certain stage of civilisation should have been
reached by the Society in the midst of which such an institution is
to be established, a healthful atmosphere must be prepared for it.
If I am not mistaken, it is to friendly societies, with the material
resources which they create, and the spirit of association, the
experience, the foresight, and the sense of dignity which they
infuse into the working classes, that we are to owe the establishment
of those kindred institutions which provide for the old age
of the workman.</p>

<p>For if you observe what is going on in England, you will be
<a id="p374" class="xxpn">[p374]</a> satisfied that all such things are bound up together and depend
upon each other, and that one step of progress, in order to be
attainable, must be preceded by another step of progress.</p>

<p>In England all the adults to whom it is an object to join benefit
societies have done so of their own accord; and that is a point of
very great importance, seeing that operations of this kind require to
be conducted on a great scale, and according to the law of averages.</p>

<p>These societies are possessed of large accumulated capitals, and
have, besides, considerable annual revenues.</p>

<p>We cannot help thinking that, with the advance of civilisation,
the prodigious sums which these societies now require to pay to
their members will become proportionally smaller and smaller.</p>

<p>Good health is one of the benefits which civilisation develops.
The healing art makes progress; machinery performs the harder
and more painful part of labour; longevity increases. All these
causes tend to lessen the calls on such associations.</p>

<p>A still more decisive and infallible symptom is the disappearance
of great commercial crises in England. Such convulsions
have had their origin sometimes in sudden manias with which the
English are now and then seized for enterprises which are more
than hazardous, and which entail a great loss of capital; sometimes
they arise from great fluctuations in the price of food, the
consequence of restrictive laws, for it is evident that when the
price of bread and butcher’s meat is very high, all the resources of
the people are absorbed in the purchase of necessaries, and other
branches of trade languish, and a stoppage of manufactures is the
inevitable result.</p>

<p>The first of these causes is now disappearing under the teachings
of experience and public discussion; and we can already foresee
that the English nation, which in former days threw itself into
American loans, Mexican mines, and railway schemes with such
sheep-like credulity, will now be much less a dupe than others to
Californian illusions.</p>

<p>What shall I say of Free Trade, the triumph of which is due to
Mr Cobden, not to Sir Robert Peel;—for the apostle would always
have called forth a statesman, but the statesman could not have
dispensed with the apostle. Here, then, we have a new power
ushered into the world, which I hope will go far to do away with
commercial stoppages and convulsions. Restriction has the
admitted tendency and effect of placing many of the manufactures
of the country, and, consequently, part of its population, in a
precarious situation. As those piled-up waves which a transient
force keeps for a moment above the level of the sea have a <a id="p375" class="xxpn">[p375]</a> constant
tendency to descend, so factitious industries, surrounded on
every side by victorious competition, have a constant tendency to
collapse. A modification in a single article of a single home or
foreign tariff may bring ruin to them; and then comes a crisis.
The variations in the price of a commodity, moreover, are much
greater when you limit the field of competition. Surround a
department, or a district, with custom-houses, and you render the
fluctuation of prices much more marked. Liberty acts on the
principle of insurance. In different countries, and in successive
years, it compensates bad harvests by good ones. It sustains
prices thus brought back to the average. It is a levelling and
equalizing force. It contributes to stability, and it combats
instability which is the great source of convulsions and stoppages.
There is no exaggeration in asserting that the first fruit of Mr
Cobden’s work will be to lessen many of those dangers which gave
rise, in England, to friendly societies.</p>

<p>Mr Cobden has undertaken another task which will have a not
less beneficial influence on the stability of the labourer’s lot, and I
doubt not he will succeed in it; for good service in the cause of
truth is always triumphant. I refer to his efforts for the suppression
of war, or, what is the same thing, for the infusion of the
spirit of peace into that public opinion by which the question of
peace or war comes always to be decided. War constitutes
always the greatest disturbing force to which a nation can be
subjected in its industry, in its commerce, in the disposal of its
capital, even in its tastes. Consequently, it is a powerful cause of
derangement and uneasiness to those classes who have difficulty
in changing their employment. The more, of course, this disturbing
force is lessened, the less onerous will the burdens be
which fall upon benefit societies.</p>

<p>On the other hand, by dint of progress, by the mere lapse of
time, the resources of these societies will be extended; and a day
will come when they can undertake something more decisive—with
a view to lessen the instability which is inherent in human
affairs. These societies might then be transformed into <em class="e000I2">Caisses de
Retraite</em>, or institutions for old age, and this will undoubtedly
happen, since it is the ardent and universal desire of the working
classes that it should be so.</p>

<p>And it is worthy of remark, that while material circumstances
thus pave the way for such a transformation, moral circumstances
arising from the influence of these very societies tend in the same
direction. These societies develop among the working classes
habits, qualities, and virtues, the possession and diffusion of which
<a id="p376" class="xxpn">[p376]</a> are in this respect an essential preliminary. When we examine
the matter closely, we must be convinced that the creation of such
societies presupposes a very advanced stage of civilisation. They
are at once its effect and its reward. They could, in fact, have no
existence if men had not been previously in the habit of meeting,
of acting in concert, and of managing in common their own affairs;
they could not exist if men were prone to vices which induce premature
old age; nor could they exist were the working classes
brought to think that everything is fair as against the public, and
that a common fund is the object at which every one intent on
fraud may legitimately take aim.</p>

<p>In order that the establishment of <em class="e000I2">Caisses de Retraite</em> should
not give rise to discord and misunderstanding, the working classes
should be made to feel that they must depend upon nobody but
themselves; that the common fund must be voluntarily created by
those who are to have the benefit of it; and that it is supremely
unjust and anti-social to call for co-operation from other classes,
who are to have no share in the advantage, and who can only be
made to concur by means of the tax-gatherer, that is to say, by
means of force. Now, we have not yet got that length—so far
from it that the frequent appeals to the State show us but too
plainly what are the hopes and pretensions of the working classes.
They think that their benefit society should be fed and alimented
by State subventions like that for public functionaries. And thus
it is that one abuse always gives rise to another.</p>

<p>But if these <em class="e000I2">Caisses de Retraite</em> are to be maintained exclusively
by the parties interested, may it not be said that they exist already,
seeing that life assurance companies present combinations which
enable every workman to provide for the future by the sacrifice of
the present?</p>

<p>I have dwelt at great length upon friendly societies and <em class="e000I2">Caisses
de Retraite</em>, although these institutions are only indirectly connected
with the subject of this chapter. I have given way to the
desire to exhibit mankind marching gradually on to the conquest
of stability, or rather (for stability implies something stationary),
emerging victorious from their struggle with <em class="e000I2">uncertainty</em>—uncertainty,
that standing menace which mars all the enjoyments of
life, that sword of Damocles which seems so fatally suspended over
the human destinies. That this menace may be progressively and
indefinitely rendered less formidable by reducing to an average the
risks and chances of all times, of all places, and of all men, is
certainly one of the most admirable social harmonies which can
be presented to the view of the philosophic economist. <a id="p377" class="xxpn">[p377]</a></p>

<p>We must not, however, conclude that this victory depends upon
these two institutions, the establishment of which may be more or
less accidental. No; did experience even demonstrate these institutions
to be impracticable, the human race would not the less
find its way to fixity. It is enough to know that uncertainty
is an evil, in order to be assured that it will be incessantly, and,
sooner or later, successfully, combated; for such is the law of our
nature.</p>

<p>If, as we have seen, the system of remunerating labour by wages
is, as regards stability, a more advanced form of association between
capital and labour, it still leaves too much room for the uncertain.
As long as he continues to work, the labourer knows on what he
has to depend. But how long will he have employment, and how
long will he be fit for work? This is what he is ignorant of, and,
as regards his future, it places before him a fearful problem for
solution. The uncertainty which affects the capitalist is different.
With him it is not a question of life or death. “I shall always
derive an interest from my means; but will that interest be higher
or lower?” That is the question which affects capital or anterior
labour.</p>

<p>Sentimental philanthropists who see in this a frightful inequality
which they desire to get rid of by artificial, sometimes by unjust
and violent, means, do not consider that after all we cannot change
the nature of things. Anterior labour must necessarily have more
security than present labour, simply for this reason, that products
already created must always present more certain resources than
products which are yet to be created; that services already rendered,
received, and estimated, present a more solid foundation for the
future than services which are still in the state of supply. If you
are not surprised that of two fishermen, the one who, having long
laboured and saved, possesses lines, nets, boats, and some previous
supply of fish, is more at ease as regards his future than the other
who has absolutely nothing but his willingness to take part in the
work, why should you be astonished that the social order presents
to a certain extent the same differences? In order to justify the
envy, the jealousy, the absolute spitefulness with which the labourer
regards the capitalist, it would be necessary to conclude that the
relative stability of the one is caused by the instability of the
other. But it is the reverse which is true. It is precisely the
capital which pre-exists in the hands of one man which is the
guarantee of the wages of another, however insufficient that guarantee
may appear. But for that capital, the uncertainty of the
labourer would be still greater and more striking. Would the
<a id="p378" class="xxpn">[p378]</a> increase, and the extension to all, of that uncertainty be any advantage
to the labourer?</p>

<p>Two men run equal risks, which we may represent, for each, as
equal to 40. One of them succeeds so well, by his labour and his
foresight, that he reduces the risks which affect him to 10. Those
of his companion from the same cause, and in consequence of a
mysterious solidarity, are reduced, not to 10, but to 20. What
can be more just than that the man who has the greater merit
should reap the greater reward? What more admirable than that
the other should profit by the virtues of his neighbour? Now,
this is just what philanthropy repudiates under the pretext that
such an order of things is opposed to equality.</p>

<p>Suppose that one fine day the old fisherman should thus address
his companion: “You have neither boat, nor nets, nor any
instrument to fish with, except your hands, and you are likely to
make but a poor business of it. You have no stock of provisions,
and it is poor work to fish with an empty stomach. Come along
with me—it is your interest as well as mine. It is yours, for I
will give you a share of the fish which we take, and, whatever
the quantity be, it will at least be greater than the produce of
your isolated exertions. It is my interest also, for the additional
quantity caught with your assistance will be greater than the
share I will have to give you. In short, the union of your labour
with my labour and capital, as compared with their isolated
action, will produce a <em class="e000I2">surplus</em>, and it is the division of this surplus
which explains how association may be of advantage to both
of us.”</p>

<p>They proceed in this way in the first instance; but afterwards
the young fisher will prefer to receive every day a fixed quantity
of fish. His uncertain and fluctuating profits are thus converted
into wages, without the advantages of association being destroyed,
and, by stronger reason, without the association itself being dissolved.</p>

<p>And it is in such circumstances as these that the pretended
philanthropy of the Socialists comes to declaim against the tyranny
of boats and nets, against the situation, naturally less uncertain,
of him who possesses them, and who has come to possess them
just because he has constructed them in order to obviate this uncertainty!
It is in such circumstances that they endeavour to
persuade the destitute young fisherman that he is the victim of
his <em class="e000I2">voluntary</em> arrangement with the old fisherman, and that he
ought instantly to return to his state of isolation!</p>

<p>To assert that the future of the capitalist is less uncertain than
<a id="p379" class="xxpn">[p379]</a> that of the workman, is just to assert that the man who already
possesses is in a better situation than the man who does not yet
possess. It is so, and it must be so, for it is for this very reason
that men aspire to possess.</p>

<p>The tendency, then, is for men to cease being workmen in
receipt of wages in order to become capitalists. This progress is
in conformity with human nature. What workman does not desire
to have tools of his own, a stock of his own, a warehouse, a workshop,
a field, a dwelling-house, of his own? What workman but
aspires to become an employer? Who is not delighted to command
after having long obeyed? Do the great laws of the economic
world, does the natural play of the social organs, favour or
oppose this tendency? This is the last question which we shall
examine in connexion with the subject of wages.</p>

<p>Can its solution be attended with any doubt?</p>

<p>Let us revert once more to the necessary evolution of production:
gratuitous utility substituting itself incessantly for onerous
utility; human efforts constantly diminishing in relation to each
result, and, when rendered disposable, embarking in new enterprises;
every hour’s labour corresponding to an always increasing
amount of enjoyment. How, from these premises, can we fail to
deduce a progressive increase of <em class="e000I2">useful efforts</em> to be distributed,
consequently a sustained amelioration of the labourer’s condition,
consequently, also, an endless increase and progression of that
amelioration?</p>

<p>For here the effect having become a cause, we see progress not
only advance, but become accelerated by its advance; <em class="e000I2">vires acquirere
eundo</em>. In point of fact, from century to century accumulation
becomes more easy, as the remuneration of labour becomes more
ample. Then accumulation increases capital, increases the demand
for labour, and causes an elevation of wages. This rise of wages,
in its turn, facilitates accumulation and the transformation of the
paid labourer into a capitalist. Between the remuneration of
labour and the accumulation of capital, then, there is a constant
action and reaction, which is always favourable to the labouring
class, always tending to relieve that class from the yoke of urgent
necessity.</p>

<p>It may be said, perhaps, that I have brought together here all
that can dazzle the hopes of the working classes, and that I have
concealed all that could cause them discouragement. If there are
tendencies towards equality, it may be said, there are also tendencies
towards inequality. Why do you not analyze the whole,
in order to explain the true situation of the labouring classes, and
<a id="p380" class="xxpn">[p380]</a> thus bring science into accord with the melancholy facts to which
it seems to shut its eyes? You show us gratuitous utility substituted
for onerous utility, the gifts of God falling more and more
into the domain of community, and, by that very fact, human
labour obtaining a continually increasing recompense. From this
increase of remuneration you deduce an increased facility of accumulation,
and from this facility of accumulation a new increase of
remuneration, leading to new and still more abundant accumulations,
and so on <em class="e000I2">ad infinitum</em>. It may be that this system is as
logical as it is optimist; it may be that we are not in a situation to
oppose to it a scientific refutation. But where are the facts which
confirm it? Where do we find realized this emancipation from
paid labour? Is it in the great centres of manufactures? Is
it among the agricultural labourers? And if your theoretical
predictions are not accomplished, is not this the reason, that
alongside the economic laws which you invoke, there are other
laws which act in an opposite direction, and of which you say
nothing. For instance, why do you tell us nothing of that competition
which takes place among workmen, and which forces
them to accept of lower wages; of that urgent want of the
necessaries of life which presses upon the labourer, and obliges
him to submit to the conditions of the capitalist, so that, in fact,
it is the most destitute, famished, isolated, and consequently the
most clamant and exacting workman who fixes the rate of wages
for all? And if, in spite of so many obstacles, the condition of
our unfortunate fellow-citizens comes to be improved, why do you
not show us that law of population which steps in with its fatal
action, multiplying the multitude, stirring up competition, increasing
the supply of labour, deciding the controversy in
favour of the capitalist, and reducing the workman to receive,
for twelve or sixteen hours’ labour, only <em class="e000I2">what is indispensable</em>
(that, forsooth, is the consecrated phrase) <em class="e000I2">to the maintenance of
life</em>?</p>

<p>If I have not touched upon all these phases of the question, the
reason is, that it is scarcely possible to include everything within
the limits of a single chapter. I have already explained the
general law of Competition, and we have seen that that law is
far from furnishing any class, especially the poorer class, with
serious reasons for discouragement. I shall, by-and-by, explain
the law of Population, which will be found, I hope, in its general
effects, not more severe. It is not my fault if each great solution—such,
for example, as the future of a whole class of men—cannot
be educed from one isolated economic law, and consequently from
<a id="p381" class="xxpn">[p381]</a> one chapter of this work, but must be educed from the aggregate
of these laws, or from the work taken as a whole.</p>

<p>And here I must remind the reader of a distinction, which is by
no means a subtlety, that when we have to do with an effect, we
must take good care not to attribute it to the action of general and
providential laws, if, on the contrary, it be found to proceed from
a violation of these very laws.</p>

<p>I by no means ignore the calamities which, under all forms,—excessive
labour, insufficient wages, uncertainty as to the future, a
feeling of inferiority,—bear hard upon those of our fellow-citizens
who have not yet been able, by the acquisition of Property, to
raise themselves to a higher and more comfortable condition. But,
then, we must acknowledge that uncertainty, destitution, and
ignorance constitute the starting-point of the whole human race;
and this being so, the question, it seems to me, is to discover,—1<em class="e000I2">st</em>,
If the general providential laws do not tend to relieve all
classes from the weight of this triple yoke; 2<em class="e000I2">dly</em>, If the conquests
already secured by the more advanced classes do not constitute a
facility prepared beforehand for the classes which yet lag behind.
If the answer to these questions be in the affirmative, we may conclude
that the social harmony is established, and that the ways of
Providence are vindicated, if, indeed, they needed vindication.</p>

<p>Man being endowed with discretion and free will, the beneficent
laws of Providence can profit him only while he conforms himself
to their operation; and although I affirm that man’s nature is perfectible,
I must not be understood to assert that he makes progress
when he misunderstands or violates these laws. Thus, I maintain
that transactions which are natural, free, voluntary, and exempt
from fraud or violence, have in themselves a principle of progress
for all. But that is not to affirm that progress is inevitable, and
must spring from war, monopoly, or imposture. I maintain that
wages have a tendency to rise, that this rise facilitates saving, and
that saving, in its turn, raises wages. But if the class which lives
by wages, in consequence of habits of dissipation and debauchery,
neutralize at the outset this cause of progressive effects, I do not
say that those effects will exhibit themselves in the same way, for
the contrary is implied in my affirmation.</p>

<p>In order to bring the scientific deduction to the test of facts, we
must take two epochs; for example, 1750 and 1850.</p>

<p>We must first of all establish what, at these two periods, was the
proportion of <em class="e000I2">prolétaires</em> to <em class="e000I2">propriétaires</em>—of the men who live by
wages without having any realized property, to the men in the
actual possession of property. We shall find, I presume, that for
<a id="p382" class="xxpn">[p382]</a> a century the number of people who possess some resources has
much increased relatively to the number of those who are in possession
of no resources whatever.</p>

<p>We must then discover the specific situation of each of these two
classes, which we cannot do otherwise than by observing the
enjoyments and satisfactions which they possess; and very probably
we shall find that in our day they derive a greater amount of
real satisfaction and enjoyment, the one from accumulated labour,
the other from present labour, than was possible in the middle of
the last century.</p>

<p>If the respective and relative progress of these classes, especially
of the working class, has not been what we could wish, we must
then inquire whether it has not been more or less retarded by acts
of injustice and violence, by errors, by passions—in a word, by
faults incident to mankind, by contingent causes which we cannot
confound with what are called the great and constant laws of the
social economy. Have we not, for example, had wars and revolutions
which might have been avoided? And have not these
atrocities, in the first instance, absorbed and afterwards dissipated
an incalculable amount of capital, consequently diminished the
funds for the payment of wages, and retarded the emancipation of
the working classes? Have they not diverted capital from its
legitimate employment, seeking to derive from it, not enjoyment,
but destruction? Have we not had monopolies, privileges, and
unequal taxation? Have we not had absurd expenditure, ridiculous
fashions, and a loss of power, which can be attributed only to
puerile tastes and prejudices?</p>

<p>And what has been the consequence?</p>

<p>There are general laws to which man may conform himself, or
which he may violate.</p>

<p>If it be incontestable that Frenchmen, during the last hundred
years, have frequently run counter to the natural order of social
development; if we cannot forbear to attribute to incessant wars,
to periodical revolutions, to acts of injustice, to monopolies, to dissipation,
to follies of all kinds, a fearful sacrifice of the power of
capital and of labour;</p>

<p>And if, on the other hand, in spite of all this, which is undeniable,
we can establish another fact—namely, that during this
same period of a hundred years the class possessed of property has
been recruited from the labouring class, and that both have at the
same time had at their command a greater amount of satisfaction
and enjoyment—do we not, by rigorous deduction, arrive at this
conclusion, namely, that, <a id="p383" class="xxpn">[p383]</a></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">The general laws of the social world are in harmony, and that they
tend in all respects to the improvement of the human race?</em></p>

<p>For since, after a period of a hundred years, during which these
laws have been so frequently and so deeply violated, men find
themselves in a more advanced state of comfort and well-being, the
action of these laws must be beneficent, and sufficiently so even to
compensate the action of disturbing causes.</p>

<p>How indeed could it be otherwise? Is there not something
equivocal, or rather redundant, in the expression, <em class="e000I2">beneficent general
laws</em>? How can general laws be other than beneficent? When
God placed in man’s heart an irresistible impulse to what is good,
and, to enable him to discern it, imparted to him sufficient light to
enable him to rectify his errors, from that moment He decreed that
the human race was perfectible, and that, in spite of many errors,
difficulties, deceptions, oppressions, and oscillations, mankind should
still march onwards on the road of progress. This onward march,
while error, deception, and oppression are absent, is precisely what
we denominate the general laws of the social order. Errors and
oppressions are what I call the violation of these laws, or disturbing
causes. It is not possible, then, to doubt that the one should
be beneficent, and the other the reverse, unless we go the length of
doubting whether disturbing causes may not act in a manner more
regular and permanent than general laws. Now that conclusion
would contradict the premises. Our intelligence, which may be
deceived, can rectify its errors, and it is evident that, the social
world being constituted as it is, error might sooner or later be
checked by Responsibility, and that, sooner or later, oppression
must be destroyed by Solidarity. Whence it follows that disturbing
causes are not in their nature permanent, and it is for that
reason that the laws which countervail the action of such disturbances
merit the name of General laws.</p>

<p>In order to conform ourselves to general laws, it is necessary
to be acquainted with them. Allow me then to enlarge
a little on the relations, so ill understood, of the capitalist and the
labourer.</p>

<p>Capital and labour are indispensable to one another. Perpetually
confronting each other, their adjustment constitutes one of the most
important and most interesting subjects which can come under the
observation of the economist. And it is a solemn consideration
that erroneous notions and superficial observations on this subject,
if they become popular, may give rise to inveterate heartburnings,
struggles, and bloodshed.</p>

<p>Now, I express my deliberate conviction when I say that for
<a id="p384" class="xxpn">[p384]</a> some years the public mind has been saturated with the falsest
theories on this subject. We have been told that free and voluntary
transactions between the capitalist and the labourer lead, not
accidentally, but necessarily, to monopoly for the capitalist, and
oppression for the labourer; from which the obvious conclusion is,
that liberty ought everywhere to be put down and stifled; for, I
repeat, that when men have accused liberty of engendering monopoly,
they have pretended not only to assert a fact, but to establish
a law. In support of this thesis they have appealed to the action
of machinery and of competition. M. de Sismondi was, I believe,
the founder, and M. Buret the propagator, of these unhappy
doctrines, although the latter has stated his conclusions very
timidly, and the former has not ventured to state any conclusion
at all. But bolder spirits have succeeded them, who, after
trumpeting their hatred to capitalists and men of property, after
having got the masses to accept as an incontestable axiom the discovery
that <em class="e000I2">liberty leads inevitably to monopoly</em>, have, whether designedly
or not, induced the people to raise their hands against
this accursed liberty.<a
href="#FN_81" id="FNa_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> Four days of a sanguinary struggle
brought emancipation, without restoring confidence; for do we not
constantly discover the hand of the State (obedient in this to vulgar
prejudices) ever ready to interpose in the relations of capital and
labour?</p>

<p>We have already deduced the action of competition from our
theory of value, and we shall do the same thing as regards the
effects of machinery.<a
href="#FN_82" id="FNa_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> We must limit ourselves in this place to
an exposition of some general ideas upon the subject of the reciprocal
relations of the capitalist and the labourer.</p>

<p>The fact with which our pessimist reformers are much struck in
the outset is, that the capitalists are richer than the workmen, and
obtain a greater amount of satisfactions and enjoyments; whence
it results that they appropriate to themselves a greater, and consequently
an unjust, share of the product elaborated by their joint
exertions. It is in this direction that their statistics, more or less
impartial, professing to explain the condition of the working classes,
tend.</p>

<p>These gentlemen forget that absolute poverty and destitution is
the inevitable starting-point of the human race, and that men continue
inevitably in this state until they have acquired something
for themselves, or have had something acquired for them by others.
<a id="p385" class="xxpn">[p385]</a> To remark, in the gross, that capitalists are better off than mere
workmen, is simply to assert that those who have something, have
more than those who have nothing.</p>

<p>The questions which the workman ought to ask himself are not,
“Does my labour give me much? Does it give me little? Does it
give me as much as it gives to another? Does it give me what I
desire?” The questions he should ask himself are these: “Does my
labour give me less because I employ it in the service of the capitalist?
Would it give me more if I worked in a state of isolation,
or if I associated my labour with that of other workmen as destitute
as myself? I am ill situated, but would I be better off were
there no such thing as capital in the world? If the part which I
obtain in consequence of my arrangement with capital is greater
than what I would obtain without that arrangement, what reason
have I to complain? And then, according to what laws would
our respective shares go on increasing or diminishing were transactions
free? If it be of the nature of these transactions to allow
me, in proportion as the total product to be divided increases, to
obtain a continually increasing proportion of the excess (c. vii.,
p. 212), then in place of breathing hatred against capital, ought I
not to treat it as a friend? If it be indisputably established
that the presence of capital is favourable to my interests, and that
its absence would be death to me, am I very prudent or well-advised
in calumniating it, frightening it away, and forcing its
dissipation or flight?” In the discussion which precedes the bargain,
an inequality of situation is constantly alleged, because capital
can afford to wait, but labour cannot. The one upon which the
greatest pressure bears must give way to the other, so that the
capitalist in reality fixes the rate of wages.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, looking at the surface of things, he who has created
a stock, and who in consequence of this foresight can wait on, has
the advantage in the bargain. Taking even an isolated transaction,
the man who says, <em class="e000I2">Do ut facias</em>, is not in such a hurry to come to
a conclusion as the man who replies, <em class="e000I2">Facio ut des</em>. For, when a
man can say <em class="e000I2">do</em>, he possesses something to give; and when he
possesses something to give, he can wait.<a
href="#FN_83" id="FNa_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>We must not, however, lose sight of this, that value has the
same principle, whether it resides in the service or in the product.
If one of the parties says <em class="e000I2">do</em>, in place of <em class="e000I2">facio</em>, it is because he has
had the foresight to execute the <em class="e000I2">facio</em> beforehand. In reality, it is
the service on both sides which is the measure of the value. Now,
<a id="p386" class="xxpn">[p386]</a> if delay for present labour is a suffering, for anterior labour it is a
loss. We must not then suppose that a man who says <em class="e000I2">do</em>, the
capitalist, will amuse himself (above all if we consider the aggregate
of his transactions) by deferring the bargain. In point of
fact, do we see much capital idle for this reason? Do many
manufacturers stop their mills, or shipowners delay their voyages,
or agriculturists defer their harvests, on purpose to depreciate
wages, and get hold of their workmen by means of famine?</p>

<p>But without denying that the position of the capitalists in
relation to the workman is favourable in this respect, is there not
something else to be considered with reference to their arrangements?
For instance, is it not a circumstance quite in favour of
<em class="e000I2">present labour</em> that <em class="e000I2">accumulated labour</em> loses value by mere lapse of
time? I have elsewhere alluded to this phenomenon. But it is
important to solicit the reader’s attention again to it in this place,
seeing how great an influence it has upon the remuneration of
present labour.</p>

<p>That which in my opinion renders Adam Smith’s theory, that
<em class="e000I2">value comes from labour</em>, false, or at least incomplete, is that this
theory assigns to value only one element, whilst, being a relation,
it has necessarily two. Besides, if value springs exclusively from
labour, and represents it, it would be proportionate to that labour,
which is contrary to all observed facts.</p>

<p>No; value comes from service received and rendered; and the
service depends as much, if not more, on the pains saved to the
man who receives it, as upon the pains taken by the man who
renders it. In this respect the most common facts confirm our
reasoning. When I purchase a product, I may indeed ask myself,
“How long time has it taken to make it?” And this undoubtedly
is one of the elements of my estimate of its value. But
again, and above all, I ask, “How long time would it take me to
make it? How long time have I taken to make the thing which
is asked from me in exchange?” When I purchase a service, I
not only ask how much it will cost another to render that service
to me, but how much it would cost me to render that service to
myself.</p>

<p>These personal questions, and the answers which they call forth,
are such essential elements in every estimate of value, that they
most frequently determine it.</p>

<p>Try to purchase a diamond which has been found by chance.
The seller will transfer to you very little labour, but he will ask
from you a great deal. Why, then, should you consent to this?
Because you take into account the labour which it saves you, the
<a id="p387" class="xxpn">[p387]</a> labour which you would be obliged to undergo in order to satisfy
by any other means your desire to possess a diamond.</p>

<p>When an exchange, then, takes place between <em class="e000I2">anterior labour</em>
and <em class="e000I2">present labour</em>, it is not at all on the footing of their intensity
or duration, but on that of their value, that is to say, of the service
which they render, and their relative utility. If the capitalist
shall say, “Here is a product which cost me formerly ten hours’
labour;” and if the labourer be in a situation to reply, “I can
produce the same thing in five hours,” the capitalist would be
forced to give up the difference; for, I repeat, that it does not
concern the present acquirer of a commodity to ask how much
labour it formerly cost to produce it. What concerns him is to
know what labour it will save him now, what service he is to
expect from it.</p>

<p>A capitalist, in a general sense, is a man who, having foreseen
that such or such a service would be in demand, has prepared
beforehand to satisfy this demand by incorporating the value in a
commodity.</p>

<p>When labour has been thus expended by anticipation, in expectation
of future remuneration, we cannot tell whether, on a definite
future day, it will render exactly the same service, or save the
same pains, or preserve, consequently, a uniform value. We cannot
even hazard a probable conjecture as to this. The commodity may
be very <em class="e000I2">recherché</em>, very difficult to procure in any other way; it
may come to render services which will be better appreciated, or
appreciated by more people; it may acquire an increasing value
with time,—in other words, it may exchange for a continually
increasing proportion of present labour. Thus it is not impossible
that such a product, a diamond for example, a violin of Stradivarius,
a picture of Raphaël, a vine-plant from the Château-Laffitte,
may come to exchange for a thousand times more labour than they
cost. In fact it just comes to this, that the anterior labour is well
remunerated in these cases, because it renders a great amount of
service.</p>

<p>The contrary may also happen. A commodity which has cost
four hours’ labour may come to exchange for one which has cost
only three hours’ labour of equal intensity.</p>

<p>But—and this appears to me extremely important as regards
the interests of the working classes, of those classes who aspire
so ardently to get rid of their present state of uncertainty—although
the two alternatives we have stated are both possible,
and each may be realized in its turn, although accumulated
labour may sometimes gain, and sometimes lose value, in <a id="p388" class="xxpn">[p388]</a> relation
to present labour, the first alternative, nevertheless, is so
rare as to be considered accidental and exceptional; while the
second is the result of a general law which is inherent in the very
organization of man. That man, with all his intellectual and
experimental acquisitions, is of a progressive nature, is at least
industrially speaking (for, in a moral point of view, the assertion
might be disputed) beyond doubt. It is beyond doubt that the
greater part of those commodities which exacted formerly a
given amount of labour, exact at the present day a less amount,
in consequence of improvements in machinery and the gratuitous
intervention of natural forces; and we may assert without hesitation,
that in each period of ten years, for example, a given
quantity of labour will accomplish, in the majority of cases, greater
results than the same quantity of labour could have accomplished
in the preceding decennial period.</p>

<p>What is the conclusion to be drawn from this? Obviously, that
anterior labour goes on constantly deteriorating in value relatively
to present labour; that in every act of exchange it becomes necessary
to give, of the first a greater number of hours than you
receive of the second; and this without any injustice, but simply
to maintain the equivalence of services. This is a consequence
which progress forces upon us.</p>

<p>You say to me, “Here is a machine; it was made ten years ago,
but it is still new. It cost 1000 days’ work to make it. I will
give it to you in exchange for an equal number of days’ labour.”
To this I reply, “Within the last ten years so many new tools
have been invented, and so many new processes discovered, that
I can now construct, or, what comes to the same thing, get constructed
for me, an equally good machine, with an expenditure of
only 600 days’ labour. I will not, therefore, give you more than
600 for yours.” “But I should in this way lose 400 days’ labour.”
“No,” I reply; “for 6 days’ work now are worth 10 formerly. At
all events, what you offer me for 1000 I can now procure for 600.”
This ends the debate; if the lapse of time has deteriorated the
value of your labour, there is no reason why I should bear the
loss.</p>

<p>Again you say to me, “Here is a field. In order to bring it to
its present state of productiveness, I and my ancestors have
expended 1000 days’ labour. They were unacquainted, no doubt,
with the use of axe, and saw, and spade, and did all by muscular
exertion. But no matter; give me first of all 1000 of your days’
work, as an equivalent for the 1000 which I give to you, and then
add 300 as the value of the productive power of the soil, and you <a id="p389" class="xxpn">[p389]</a>
shall have the field.” I answer, “I will not give you 1300, or even
1000, days’ labour for it; and here are my reasons: There are on
the surface of the globe an indefinite number of productive powers
which are destitute of value. We are now accustomed to handle
spade, and axe, and saw, and plough, and employ many other
means of abridging labour, and rendering it more productive; so
that, with 600 days’ work, I can either bring an uncultivated field
into the state in which yours is, or (which comes absolutely to the
same thing as far as I am concerned) <em class="e000I2">I can procure myself, by an
act of exchange, all the advantages which you reap from your field</em>.
I will give you, then, 600 days, and no more.” “In that case, not
only should I have no profit from the pretended value of the productive
powers of the soil; I should not even be reimbursed for
the actual labour which I and my ancestors have devoted to the
cultivation of this field. Is it not strange that I should be accused
by Ricardo of selling the powers of nature; by Senior of intercepting
the gifts of God; by all the Economists of being a
monopolist; by Proudhon of being a robber; while in reality I am
only a dupe?” You are no more a dupe than a monopolist. You
receive the equivalent of what you give; and it is neither natural,
nor just, nor possible, that rude labour performed with the hand
centuries ago should exchange, day for day, against the more
intelligent and productive labour of the present time.</p>

<p>Thus we see that by an admirable effect of the social mechanism,
when anterior and present labour are brought into juxtaposition,
and when the business is to know in what proportion the joint
product of both is to be divided, the specific superiority of the one
and of the other is taken into account; and they participate in the
distribution according to the relative services which they render.
In exceptional cases it may happen that this superiority is on the
side of anterior labour. But in the great majority of cases it is
otherwise; and the nature of man and the law of progress cause
the superiority to be manifested on the side of present labour.
Progress is advanced by the latter; and the deterioration falls
upon capital.</p>

<p>Independently of this result, which shows how vain and hollow
the declamations of our modern reformers on the pretended <em class="e000I2">tyranny
of capital</em> are, there is another consideration still more fitted to
extinguish in the hearts of the working classes that factitious
hatred of other classes, which it has been attempted but with too
much success to light up.</p>

<p>The consideration I refer to is this:</p>

<p>Capital, however far it may carry its pretensions, and however
<a id="p390" class="xxpn">[p390]</a> successful it may be in its endeavours to ensure the triumph of
these pretensions, can never place labour in a worse situation than
it would occupy in a state of isolation. In other words, capital
is always more favourable to labour by its presence than by its
absence.</p>

<p>Let us revert to the example which I gave a little ago.</p>

<p>Two men live by fishing. One of them has nets, lines, a boat,
and some provisions to enable him to wait for the fruit of his
labour. The other has nothing but his personal exertions. It
is their interest to associate.<a
href="#FN_84" id="FNa_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> Whatever may be the terms on
which they agree to share the produce, the condition of either of
these two fishermen, whether the rich one or the poor one, never
can be made worse, and for this obvious reason, that the moment
either of them finds association disadvantageous as compared with
isolation, he may return to isolation.</p>

<p>In savage as in pastoral, in agricultural as in industrial life, the
relations of capital and labour are always represented by this
example.</p>

<p>The absence of capital is a limit which is always within the
power of labour. If the pretensions of capital go the length of
rendering joint action less profitable for labour than isolated
action, labour can take refuge in isolation, an asylum always
open (except in a state of slavery) to voluntary association found
to be disadvantageous. Labour can always say to capital, Rather
than work jointly on the conditions which you offer me, I prefer
to work alone.</p>

<p>It may be objected that this resource is illusory and ridiculous,
that to labour isolated action is forbidden by a radical impossibility,
and that to dispense with tools and instruments would be
fatal to it.</p>

<p>This is no doubt true; but it just confirms the truth of my
assertion, that even if capital carries its exactions to an extreme
limit, it still benefits labour by the very fact of its being associated
with it. Labour can be brought into a worse condition than the
worst association only when all association ceases and capital
retires. Cease, then, apostles of misfortune, to cry out against
the tyranny of capital, since you allow that its action is always—in
a greater or less degree, no doubt, but always—beneficent.
Singular tyranny, whose power is beneficial to all those who desire
to feel its effects, and is hurtful only when withdrawn.</p>

<p>But the objector may still insist that, although this might be so
in the earlier stages of society, capital has at the present day
<a id="p391" class="xxpn">[p391]</a> invaded everything. It occupies every post, it lays hold of every
field. The working man has no longer either air, or space, or soil
to put his foot on, or stone to lay his head on, without the permission
of capital. He is subject to its inexorable law, and you
would afford him no refuge but isolation, which you admit is
death!</p>

<p>All this displays a deplorable confusion of ideas, and a total
ignorance of the social economy.</p>

<p>If, as has been said, capital has possessed itself of all the forces
of nature, of all lands, of all space, I would ask for whose profit?
For the profit of the capitalist, no doubt. But then, how does
it happen that a simple workman, who has nothing but his
muscular powers, can obtain in France, in England, in Belgium,
a thousand, a million times greater amount of satisfaction and enjoyment
than he could have reaped in a state of isolation,—not
on the social hypothesis which you repudiate, but on that other
hypothesis which you cherish and cling to, that which presupposes
capital to have been guilty of no usurpation.</p>

<p>I shall continue to entertain this view of the subject, until your
new science can give a better account of it; for I am convinced I
have assigned valid reasons for the conclusion at which I have
arrived.—(Chapter vii.)</p>

<p>Take the first workman you meet with on the streets of Paris.
Find out the amount of his earnings and the amount of enjoyments
he can procure himself, and when you have fired off both against
that monster, capital, I will step in, and thus address the workman:</p>

<p>We are about to annihilate capital and all its works; and I am
going to place you in the midst of a hundred thousand acres of the
most fertile land, which I shall give you in full property and possession,
with everything above and below ground. You will not
be elbowed by any capitalist. You will have the full enjoyment
of the four natural rights of hunting, fishing, reaping the fruits, and
pasturing the land. True, you will have no capital; for if you
had, you would be in precisely the situation you censure in the
case of others. But you will no longer have reason to complain
of landlordism, capitalism, individualism, usurers, stockjobbers,
bankers, monopolists. The land will be absolutely and entirely
yours. Think if you would like to accept this position.</p>

<p>This workman would, no doubt, imagine at first that he had
obtained the fortune of a monarch. On reflection, however, he
would probably say: Well, let us calculate. Even when a man
possesses a hundred thousand acres of land, he must live. Now,
how does the <em class="e000I2">bread</em> account stand in the two situations? At
<a id="p392" class="xxpn">[p392]</a> present I earn half-a-crown a day. At the present price of corn I can
have three bushels a week, just as if I myself sowed and reaped.
Were I proprietor of a hundred thousand acres of land, at the

SAVING.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
<em class="e000I2">To save</em> is not to accumulate quantities of corn, of game, or of
crown-pieces. This hoarding-up of material and consumable commodities,
which must necessarily from its nature be restrained
within narrow bounds, represents only <em class="e000I2">the saving</em> of man in a state
of isolation. All that we have hitherto said of value, of services,
of relative wealth, shows us that, socially, saving, although it proceeds
from the same source, develops itself differently and assumes
another character.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">To save</em> is to interpose voluntarily an interval between the time
when we render services to society and the time when we receive
back from society equivalent services. A man, for example, may
every day, from the time he is twenty until he is sixty, render to
his neighbours professional services equal to four, and demand from
them services only equal to three. In that case he reserves the
power of drawing upon society in his old age, and when he can no
longer work, for payment of the remaining fourth of his forty years’
labour.</p>

<p>The circumstance that he has received and accumulated through
a succession of years notes of acknowledgment consisting of bills
of exchange, promissory notes, bank notes, money, is quite secondary,
and belongs only to the form of the transaction. It has relation
only to the means of execution. It changes neither the nature
nor the consequences of saving. The illusion to which the intervention
of money gives rise in this respect is not the less an illusion,
although we are almost always the dupes of it.</p>

<p>In fact, it is with difficulty that we can avoid believing that the
man who saves withdraws from circulation a certain amount of
value, and, in consequence, does a certain amount of harm to
society.</p>

<p>And here we encounter one of those apparent contradictions
<a id="p394" class="xxpn">[p394]</a> which are at war with logic, one of those barriers which would
seem to oppose an insurmountable obstacle to progress, one of those
dissonances which gives us pain by appearing to call in question
the Divine power and will.</p>

<p>On the one hand, we know that the human race can only extend
itself, raise itself, improve itself, acquire leisure, stability, and, by
consequence, intellectual development and moral culture, by the
abundant creation and persevering accumulation of capital. It is
this rapid augmentation of capital on which depends the demand
for labour, the elevation of wages, and, consequently, the progress
of men towards equality.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, <em class="e000I2">to save</em> is not the opposite of <em class="e000I2">to spend</em>, and
if the man who spends gives a fillip to industry and additional
employment to labour, does the man who saves not do exactly the
reverse? If every one set himself to economize as much as possible,
we should see labour languish in the same proportion, and if all
could be saved, we should have no fund for the employment of
labour.</p>

<p>In such circumstances, what advice can we give? And what
solid basis can political economy offer to morals, when we appear
to be able to educe from the former only this contradictory and
melancholy alternative:—</p>

<p>“<em class="e000I2">If you do not save</em>, capital will not be replaced, but dissipated,
the labouring class will be multiplied, while the fund for their
remuneration will remain stationary; they will enter into competition
with each other, and offer their services at a lower rate;
wages will be depressed, and society will, in this respect, be on the
decline. It will be on the decline also in another respect, for
unless you save you will be without bread in your old age; you
can no longer set your son out in the world, give a portion to your
daughter, or enlarge your trade,” etc.</p>

<p>“<em class="e000I2">If you do save</em>, you diminish the fund for wages, you injure a
great number of your fellow-citizens, you strike a blow at labour,
which is the universal creator of human satisfactions, and you
lower, consequently, the general level of humanity.”</p>

<p>Now these frightful contradictions disappear before the explanation
which we have given of saving—an explanation founded upon
the ideas to which our inquiries on the subject of value conducted
us.</p>

<p>Services are exchanged for services.</p>

<p>Value is the appreciation of two services compared with each
other.</p>

<p>In this view, <em class="e000I2">to save</em> is to have rendered a service, and allow time
<a id="p395" class="xxpn">[p395]</a> for receiving the equivalent service, or, in other words, to interpose
an interval of time between the service rendered and the service
received.</p>

<p>Now, in what respect can a man do injury to society or to labour
who merely abstains from drawing upon society for a service to
which he has right? I can exact the value which is due to me
upon the instant, or I may delay exacting it for a year. In that
case I give society a year’s respite. During that interval, labour
is carried on, and services are exchanged, just as if I did not exist.
I have not by this means caused any disturbance. On the contrary,
I have added one satisfaction more to the enjoyments of my
fellow-citizens, and they possess it for a year gratuitously.</p>

<p>Gratuitously is not the word, for I must go on to describe the
phenomenon.</p>

<p>The interval of time which separates the two services exchanged
is itself the subject of a bargain, of an exchange, for it is possessed
of <em class="e000I2">value</em>. It is the origin and explanation of <em class="e000I2">interest</em>.</p>

<p>A man, for instance, renders a present service. His wish is to
receive the equivalent service only ten years hence. Here, then, is
a value of which he refuses himself the immediate enjoyment.
Now, it is of the nature of <em class="e000I2">value</em> to be able to assume all possible
forms. With a determinate value, we are sure to obtain any
imaginable service, whether productive or unproductive, of an
equal value. He who delays for ten years to call in a debt, not
only delays an enjoyment, but he delays the possibility of further
production. It is on this account that he will meet with people in
the world who are disposed to bargain for this delay. They will say
to him: “You are entitled to receive immediately a certain value.
It suits you to delay receiving it for ten years. Now, for these
ten years, make over your right to me, place me in your room and
stead. I shall receive for you the amount for which you are a
creditor. I will employ it during these ten years in a productive
enterprise, and repay you at the end of that time. By this means
you will render me a <em class="e000I2">service</em>, and as every service has a value,
which we estimate by comparing it with another service, we have
only to estimate this service which I solicit from you, and so fix
its <em class="e000I2">value</em>. This point being discussed and arranged, I shall have
to repay you at the end of the ten years, not only the value of the
service for which you are a creditor, but the value likewise of the
service which you are about to render me.”</p>

<p>It is the value of this temporary transference of values saved
which we denominate <em class="e000I2">interest</em>.</p>

<p>For the same reason that a third party may desire that we
<a id="p396" class="xxpn">[p396]</a> should transfer to him, <em class="e000I2">for an onerous consideration</em>, the enjoyment
of a value saved, the original debtor may also desire to enter into
the same bargain. In both cases this is called <em class="e000I2">asking for credit</em>.
To give credit is to give time for the acquittance of a debt, of a
value; it is to deprive oneself of the enjoyment of that value in
favour of another, it is to render a service, it is to acquire a title
to an equivalent service.</p>

<p>But to revert to the economic effects of saving, now that we are
acquainted with all the details of the phenomenon, it is very evident
that it does no injury to general activity or to labour. Even
when the man who economizes realizes his economy, and, in exchange
for services rendered, receives hard cash, and hoards it, he
does no harm to society, seeing that he has not been able to withdraw
that amount of value from society without restoring to it
equivalent values. I must add, however, that such hoarding is
improbable and exceptional, inasmuch as it is detrimental to the
personal interests of the man who would practise it. Money in
the hands of such a man may be supposed to say this: “He who
possesses me has rendered services to society, and has not been
paid for them. I have been put into his hands to serve him as
a warrant; I am at once an acknowledgment, a promise, and a
guarantee. The moment he wills it, he can, by exhibiting and
restoring me, receive back from society the services for which he
is a creditor.”</p>

<p>Now this man is in no hurry. Does it follow that he will continue
to hoard his money? No; for we have seen that the lapse
of time which separates two services exchanged becomes itself
the subject of a commercial transaction. If the man who saves
intends to remain ten years without drawing upon society for the
services that are owing to him, his interest is to substitute a representative,
in order to add to the value for which he is a creditor
the value of this special service. Saving, then, implies in no shape
actual hoarding.</p>

<p>Let moralists be no longer arrested by this consideration. . .

POPULATION.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
I have been longing to enter upon the subject of this chapter, were
it for no other purpose than to have an opportunity of vindicating
Malthus from the violent attacks which have been made upon him.
It is scarcely credible that a set of writers of no reputation or
ability, and whose ignorance is transparent in every page of their
works, should, by echoing one another’s opinions, have succeeded
in lowering in public estimation a grave, conscientious, and philanthropic
author; representing as absurd a theory which at all
events deserves to be studied with serious attention.</p>

<p>It may be that I do not myself adopt all the opinions of Malthus.
Every question has two phases: and I believe that Malthus may
have fixed his regards too exclusively upon the sombre side. In
my own economical studies and inquiries, I have been so frequently
led to the conclusion, that <em class="e000I2">whatever is the work of Providence is good</em>,
that when logic has seemed to force me to a different conclusion,
I have been inclined to distrust my logic. I am aware that this
faith in final causes is not unattended with danger to the mind of
an inquirer. But this will not prevent me from acknowledging
that there is a vast amount of truth in the admirable work of this
economist, or from rendering homage to that ardent love of mankind
by which every line of it is inspired.</p>

<p>Malthus, whose knowledge of the social economy was profound,
had a clear view of all the ingenious mechanism with which nature
has provided the human race to assure its onward march on the
road of progress. And yet he believed that human progress might
find itself entirely paralyzed by one principle, namely, the principle
of Population. In contemplating the world, he gave way to the
melancholy reflection, that “God appears to have taken great care
of the species, and very little of the individual. In fact, as regards
a certain class of animated beings, we see them endowed with a
<a id="p398" class="xxpn">[p398]</a> fecundity so prolific, a power of multiplication so extraordinary,
a profusion of germs so superabundant, that the destiny of the
species would seem undoubtedly well assured, while that of the
individuals of the species appears very precarious; for the whole
of these germs cannot be brought to life and maturity. They
must either fail to live, or must die prematurely.”</p>

<p>“Man makes no exception to this law.” [It is surprising that
this should shock the Socialists, who have never done telling us
that general must take precedence of individual right.] “This
much is certain, that God has secured the continuance of the
human race by providing it with a great power of reproduction.
The numbers of mankind, then, would come naturally, but for
prudence and foresight, to exceed what the earth could maintain.
But man is endued with foresight, and it is his reason and his will
which can alone interpose a check to this fatal progression.”</p>

<p>Setting out from these premises, which you may dispute if you
will, but which Malthus regarded as incontestable, he attached
necessarily the highest value to the exercise of foresight. For
there was no alternative;—man must either restrain voluntarily
this excessive multiplication, or else he must become subject, like
all the other species of living creatures, to the operation of positive
or repressive checks.</p>

<p>Malthus, then, believed that he could never urge men too
strongly to the exercise of foresight. His very philanthropy
engaged him to exhibit in strong relief the fatal consequences of
imprudent reproduction, in order to put men upon their guard.
He said to them: If you multiply inconsiderately, you cannot
avoid the chastisement which awaits you in some form or other,
and always in a hideous form—famine, war, pestilence, etc.
Benevolence, charity, poor-laws, and all other expedients are but
ineffectual remedies.</p>

<p>In his ardour, Malthus allowed an expression to escape him,
which, when separated from the rest of his system, and from
the sentiment which dictated it, may appear harsh. It occurred
in the first edition of his work, which was then only a brochure,
and has since become a book of four volumes. It was represented
to him that his meaning in this objectionable passage
might give rise to erroneous interpretations. He immediately
suppressed it, and it has never since reappeared in any of the
numerous editions of his Essay on Population.</p>

<p>But Mr Godwin, one of his opponents, had quoted this suppressed
passage, and the consequence was, that M. de Sismondi
(a man who, with the best intentions in the world, has done much
<a id="p399" class="xxpn">[p399]</a> mischief) reproduced this unlucky sentence. The Socialists instantly
laid hold of it, and on this they proceeded to try, condemn,
and execute Malthus. Truly, they were much indebted to
Sismondi’s learning, for they had never themselves read either
Malthus or Godwin.</p>

<p>The Socialists have thus represented an unguarded passage,
which Malthus himself had suppressed, as the basis of his system.
They repeat it <em class="e000I2">ad nauseam</em>. In a little 18mo volume, M. Pierre
Leroux reproduced it at least forty times, and it forms the stock-in-trade
of all our declamatory second-rate reformers.</p>

<p>The most celebrated and the most vigorous of that school of
writers having written an article against Malthus, I happened
one day to converse with him, and cited some opinions expressed
in the Essay on Population. I thought I perceived that he was
not acquainted with the work. I remarked to him, “You who
have refuted Malthus, have you not read his book from beginning
to end?” “I have not read it at all,” he replied. “His whole
system is to be found in one page, and is condensed in the famous
‘arithmetical and geometrical progressions’—that is enough for
me.” “It seems to me,” I said, “that you are jesting with the
public, with Malthus, with truth, with conscience, and with yourself.”</p>

<p>This is the way that opinions obtain currency with us. Fifty
ignorant people repeat in chorus something spiteful and absurd,
put forward by one more ignorant than themselves, and if it
happens to have the least connexion with the fashionable opinions
or passions of the hour, it is at once received as an axiom.</p>

<p>Science, however, it must be allowed, cannot enter on the solution
of a problem with the settled intention of establishing a foregone
conclusion, however consolatory. What should we think of
a man who should sit down to the study of physiology, resolved
beforehand to demonstrate that God has not willed that mankind
should be afflicted with diseases? Were one physiologist to
found a system on such a basis as this, and another to controvert
it by an appeal to facts, the former would most likely fly into a
rage, and tax his opponent with <em class="e000I2">impiety</em>; but it is difficult to
believe that he would go the length of accusing his opponent
himself of being the author of diseases.</p>

<p>This, however, is what has happened to Malthus. In a work
founded on facts and figures, he explained a law which has given
great offence to our optimists; and in their anxiety to ignore the
existence of this law, they have attacked Malthus with rancorous
virulence and flagrant bad faith, as if he had himself deliberately
<a id="p400" class="xxpn">[p400]</a> thrown in the way of mankind those obstacles which flowed, as he
thought, from the principle of population. It would surely have
been more philosophical to have proved simply that Malthus was
mistaken, and that his pretended law had in reality no existence.</p>

<p>Population, we must allow, is one of a numerous class of subjects
which serve to remind us that man has frequently left him
only a choice of evils. Whatever may have been its design,
suffering: has entered into the plan of Providence. Let us not,
then, seek for harmony in the absence of evil, but in the tendency
of evil to bring us back to what is good, and in the gradual contraction
of its own domain. God has indued us with free will.
It is necessary that we should <em class="e000I2">learn</em>,—which is a long and difficult
process,—and then it is necessary that we should <em class="e000I2">act</em> on the
knowledge thus acquired, which is not much less difficult. In
this way we shall gradually emancipate ourselves from suffering,
but without ever altogether escaping from it; for even when we
succeed completely in eluding chastisement, we have still to exercise
the painful effort of foresight. In freeing ourselves from the
one, we must submit ourselves to the other.</p>

<p>It is of no use to rebel against this order of things; for it
envelopes us; it is the atmosphere in which we live and breathe;
and it is with this alternative of restriction or prevention before
us, which we cannot get rid of, and cannot lose sight of, that we
proceed, with Malthus, to enter upon the problem of population.
On this great question I shall first of all assume the function of a
mere reporter, and then give you my own views. If the laws of
population can be comprised in a short aphorism, it will be a
happy thing for the advancement and diffusion of the science.
But if, from the number and the shifting nature of the postulates,
we find that these laws refuse to be shut up in a brief and
rigorous formula, we must acquiesce. Prolix exactitude is better
than delusive brevity.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>We have seen that progress consists in causing natural forces
to co-operate more and more towards the satisfaction of our wants,
so that, at each successive epoch, the same amount of utility is
obtained, whilst to society is left either more leisure, or a greater
amount of disposable labour, to be applied to the acquisition of
new enjoyments.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have demonstrated that every fresh
conquest we thus gain over nature, after having for a time brought
additional profit to the inventor, never fails to become, by the
<a id="p401" class="xxpn">[p401]</a> operation of the law of competition, the common and gratuitous
patrimony of mankind at large.</p>

<p>From these premises we should conclude that human happiness
must be enlarged, and, at the same time, rapidly equalized. That
it has not been so in reality, however, is a point beyond all
dispute. There are in the world multitudes of unfortunate
people, whose wretchedness has not been caused by their own
misdeeds.</p>

<p>How are we to account for this?</p>

<p>I believe it is owing to a multiplicity of causes. One of them
is called <em class="e000I2">spoliation</em>, or, if you will, <em class="e000I2">injustice</em>. Economists have
referred to it only incidentally, as implying some error, some false
scientific notion. Engaged in the explanation of general laws, it
is not their business, they think, to concern themselves with those
laws, when they are not in operation or violated. Spoliation,
however, has borne, and still bears, too prominent a share in
human affairs to permit even economists to throw it aside as a
consideration unworthy of being taken into account. What we
have to do with here is not accidental thefts, petty larcenies, or
isolated crimes. War, slavery, priestly impostures, privileges,
monopolies, restrictions, abuses of taxation,—these are the more
salient manifestations of spoliation. It is easy to see what
influence disturbing forces of such magnitude must have exercised,
and must still exercise by their presence, or the deep traces they
have left behind them, on the inequality of conditions; and it
will be our business hereafter to estimate the vast extent of their
effects.</p>

<p>But another cause which retards progress, and, above all, which
hinders its extension to all classes, is, as some authors think, the
principle of population.</p>

<p>And no doubt, if in proportion as wealth increases, the number
of people among whom that wealth is to be divided increases also,
and more rapidly, absolute wealth may be greater, and individual
wealth less.</p>

<p>If, moreover, there be one species of services which everybody
can render, like the services which require only muscular exertion,
and if it be just the class whose business it is to render such
services, the worst paid of all, which multiplies with the greatest
rapidity, we must conclude that labour creates for itself a fatal
competition. The lowest class will never benefit by progress, if
that class increases faster than it can spread and distribute itself.</p>

<p>You see, then, how important the principle of population is.</p>

<p>Malthus has reduced the principle to this formula: <a id="p402" class="xxpn">[p402]</a></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Population has a tendency to keep on a level with the means of
subsistence.</em></p>

<p>I cannot help remarking in passing that it is surprising that the
honour and responsibility of enunciating this principle, be it true
or false, should have been ascribed to Malthus. No writer on such
subjects since the days of Aristotle but has proclaimed it, and frequently
in the very same words.<a
href="#FN_86" id="FNa_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>It is impossible to look around us on the aggregate of animated
beings without being convinced beyond doubt that nature has been
more engrossed with the care of species than of individuals.</p>

<p>The precautions which nature has taken to ensure the perpetuity
of races are remarkable; and among these precautions, a very
noticeable one is the profusion of germs or seeds. This superabundance
appears to be calculated in an inverse ratio to the sensibility,
intelligence, and power with which each species is endowed,
to enable it to resist destruction.</p>

<p>Thus, in the vegetable kingdom, the means of reproduction, by
seeds, cuttings, etc., which a single plant can furnish, are countless.
One elm (were all its seeds to take root) might give birth in
a single year to a million of trees. Why should this not actually
happen? Because all the seeds have not the benefit of the conditions
which vegetable life exacts, namely, space and nourishment.
They are destroyed; and as plants are destitute of sensibility,
nature has spared neither the means of reproduction nor those of
destruction.</p>

<p>Animals, too, whose life is of a type akin to vegetable life, reproduce
themselves in immense numbers. Who has not wondered
that oysters, for instance, could multiply sufficiently to supply the
enormous consumption of them?</p>

<p>As we advance in the scale of animal life, we find that the means
of reproduction has been bestowed by nature with greater parsimony.</p>

<p>Vertebrated animals, especially the larger species, do not multiply
so quickly as others. The cow goes nine months, produces only
<a id="p403" class="xxpn">[p403]</a> one calf, and must suckle it for some time. Yet even among cattle
the reproductive power surpasses what might be thought absolutely
necessary. In rich countries, such as England, France, and Switzerland,
the number of animals of this description increases notwithstanding
the enormous destruction of them; and had we
boundless pastures and prairies, there can be no doubt that we
might have both a still greater destruction and more rapid reproduction
of them. I should say that if nourishment and space were
not limited, we might have in a few years ten times more oxen
and cows, even if we consumed ten times more meat. The reproductive
power of cattle, then, even laying aside the extraneous
consideration of the limitation of space and nourishment, is far
from being fully developed.</p>

<p>It is certain that the reproductive faculty in the human species
is less powerful than in any other, and it ought to be so. Man,
in the superior situation in which nature has placed him, as regards
intelligence and sympathy, ought not to be exposed to destruction
in the same degree as the inferior animals. But we are not to
suppose that <em class="e000I2">physically</em> he escapes from that law in virtue of which
all species have the faculty of multiplying to a greater extent than
space and nourishment permit.</p>

<p>I say <em class="e000I2">physically</em>, because I am speaking here only of the physiological
law.</p>

<p>There is a wide difference between the <em class="e000I2">physiological power</em> of
multiplying and <em class="e000I2">actual</em> multiplication.</p>

<p>The one is an absolute organic power when freed from all obstacle
and all limitation <em class="e000I2">ab extra</em>—the other is the effective resulting
force of this power combined with the aggregate of all the
resistance which limits and restrains it. Thus the power of multiplication
of the poppy may be a million a year, perhaps; but in a
field of poppies the actual reproduction may be stationary or even
decrease.</p>

<p>It is this physiological law that Malthus essayed to reduce to
a formula. He inquired in what period of time a given number of
men would double, <em class="e000I2">if their space and food were unlimited</em>.</p>

<p>We can see beforehand that as this hypothesis of the <em class="e000I2">complete
satisfaction of all wants</em> is never realized in practice, the <em class="e000I2">theoretic</em>
period must necessarily be shorter than any period of <em class="e000I2">actual</em>
doubling which has ever been observed.</p>

<p>Observation, in fact, gives very different results for different
countries. According to the results obtained by M. Moreau de
Jonnès, taking for basis the actual increase of population, the
period of doubling would require—in Turkey, 555 years; in <a id="p404" class="xxpn">[p404]</a> Switzerland,
227; in France, 138; in Spain, 106; in Holland, 100; in
Germany, 76; in Russia and in England, 43; and in the United
States of America, 25 years, deducting the contingent furnished
by immigration.</p>

<p>Now, what is the reason of such enormous differences? We
have no reason to think that they are the result of physiological
causes. Swiss women are as well formed and as prolific as American
women.</p>

<p>We must conclude, then, that the absolute generative power is
restrained by external obstacles. And what proves this beyond
doubt is, that it is manifested as soon as circumstances occur to remove
these obstacles. Thus an improved agriculture, new manufactures,
some new source of local wealth, leads invariably in that
locality to an increase of population. In the same way, when a
scourge like a plague, or a famine, or war, destroys a great part
of the population, we immediately find that multiplication is more
rapidly developed.</p>

<p>When an increase of population, then, is retarded, or stops, we
find that space and nourishment are awanting, or likely to be so;
that it has encountered an obstacle, or is scared by one.</p>

<p>This phenomenon, the announcement of which has brought down
so much abuse on Malthus, appears in truth beyond the reach of
doubt.</p>

<p>If you put a thousand mice into a cage, with only as much provision
as is necessary for their daily sustenance, their number, in
spite of the acknowledged fecundity of the species, can never exceed
a thousand, or if it do, there will be privation and there will
be suffering,—both tending to reduce the number. In this case it
would be correct to say that an external cause limits, not the power
of fecundity, but the result of fecundity. There would assuredly
be an antagonism between the physiological tendency and the
restraining force, and the result would be that the number would
be stationary. To prove this, increase gradually the provision
until you double it, and you will very soon find two thousand mice
in the cage.</p>

<p>And what is the answer which is made to Malthus? He is met
with the very <em class="e000I2">fact</em> upon which his theory is founded. The proof,
it is said, that the power of reproduction in man is not indefinite, is
that in certain countries the population is stationary. If the law
of progression were true, if population doubled every twenty-five
years, France, which had thirty millions of inhabitants in 1820,
would now have more than sixty millions.</p>

<p>Is this logical? <a id="p405" class="xxpn">[p405]</a></p>

<p>I begin by proving that the population of France has increased
only a fifth in twenty-five years, whilst in other countries it has
doubled. I seek for the cause of this; and I find it in the deficiency
of space and sustenance. I find that in the existing state
of cultivation, population, and national manners and habits, there is
a difficulty in creating with sufficient rapidity subsistence for generations
that might be born, or for maintaining those that are
actually born. I assert that the means of subsistence cannot be
doubled—at least that they are not doubled—in France every
twenty-five years. This is exactly the aggregate of those negative
forces which restrain, as I think, the physiological power—and you
bring forward this slowness of multiplication in order to prove that
this physiological power has no existence. Such a mode of discussing
the question is mere trifling.</p>

<p>Is the argument against the geometrical progression of Malthus
more conclusive? Malthus has nowhere asserted that, <em class="e000I2">in point of
fact</em>, population increases according to a geometrical progression.
He alleges, on the contrary, that <em class="e000I2">the fact</em> is not so, and the subject
of his inquiry has reference to the obstacles which hinder it. The
progression is brought forward merely as a formula of the <em class="e000I2">organic</em>
power of multiplication.</p>

<p>Seeking to discover in what time a given population can double
itself, <em class="e000I2">on the assumption that all its wants are supplied</em>, he fixed this
period at twenty-five years. He so fixed it, because direct observation
had shown him that this state of things actually existed among
a people, who, although very far from fulfilling all the conditions
of his hypothesis, came nearer the conditions he had assumed than
any other—namely, the people of America. This period once found,
and the question having always reference to the <em class="e000I2">virtual</em> power of
propagation, he lays it down that population <em class="e000I2">has a tendency to
increase</em> in a geometrical progression.</p>

<p>This is denied; but the denial is in the teeth of evidence. It
may be said, indeed, that the period of doubling may not be everywhere
twenty-five years; that it may be thirty, forty, or fifty years;
that it varies in different countries and races. All this is fair subject
of discussion; but granting this, it certainly cannot be said
that, on the hypothesis assumed, the progression is not geometrical.
If, in fact, a hundred couples produce two hundred in a given
time, why may not two hundred produce four hundred in an equal
time?</p>

<p>Because, say the opponents of the theory, multiplication will be
restrained.</p>

<p>This is just what Malthus has said. <a id="p406" class="xxpn">[p406]</a></p>

<p>But by what means will multiplication be restrained?</p>

<p>Malthus points out two general obstacles to indefinite multiplication,
which he has denominated the <em class="e000I2">preventive</em> and <em class="e000I2">repressive
checks</em>.</p>

<p>As population can be kept down below the level of its physiological
tendency only by a diminution of the number of births, or an
increase of the number of deaths, the nomenclature of Malthus is
undoubtedly correct.</p>

<p>Moreover, when the conditions as regards space and nourishment
are such that population cannot go beyond a certain figure, it is
evident that the destructive check has more power, in proportion
as the preventive check has less. To allege that the number of
births may increase without an increase in the number of deaths,
while the means of subsistence are stationary, would be to fall into
a manifest contradiction.</p>

<p>Nor is it less evident, <em class="e000I2">à priori</em>, and independently of other grave
economic considerations, that in such a situation voluntary self-restraint
is preferable to forced repression.</p>

<p>As far as we have yet gone, then, the theory of Malthus is in
all respects incontestable.</p>

<p>He was wrong, perhaps, in adopting this period of twenty-five
years as the limit of human fecundity, although it holds good
in the United States. I am convinced that in assuming this period
he wished to avoid the imputation of exaggeration, or of dealing
in pure abstractions. “How can they pretend,” he may have
thought, “that I give too much latitude to <em class="e000I2">the possible</em> if I found
my principle on what <em class="e000I2">actually</em> takes place?” He did not consider
that by mixing up in this way the <em class="e000I2">virtual</em> and the <em class="e000I2">real</em>, and
representing as the measure of <em class="e000I2">the law of multiplication</em>, without
reference to <em class="e000I2">the law of limitation</em>, a period which is the result of
<em class="e000I2">facts governed by both laws</em>, he should expose himself to be misunderstood.
This is what has actually happened. His geometrical
and arithmetical progressions have been laughed at; he has been
reproached for taking the United States as a type of the rest of
the world; in a word, the confusion he has given rise to by mixing
up these two distinct laws, has been seized upon to confute the
one by the other.</p>

<p>When we seek to discover the abstract power of propagation, we
must put aside for the moment all consideration of the physical
and moral checks arising from deficiency of space, food, or comfortable
circumstances. But the question once proposed in these
terms, it is quite superfluous to attempt an exact solution. This
power, in the human race, as in all organized existences, surpasses,
<a id="p407" class="xxpn">[p407]</a> in an enormous proportion, all the phenomena of rapid multiplication
that we have observed in the past, or can ever observe in the
future. Take wheat, for example: allowing five stalks for every
seed, and five grains for every stalk, one grain has the virtual
power of producing four hundred millions of grains in five years.
Or take the canine race, and suppose four puppies to each litter,
and six years of fecundity, we shall find that one couple may in
twelve years produce eight millions of cubs.</p>

<p>As regards the human race, assuming sixteen as the age of
puberty, and fecundity to cease at thirty, each couple might give
birth to eight children. It is making a large deduction to reduce
this number to one-half on account of premature deaths, since we
are reasoning on the supposition of absolute comfort and all wants
satisfied, which greatly limits the amount of mortality. However,
let us state the premises in this way, and they give us in twenty-five
years 2—4—8—16—32—64—128—256—512, etc.; in short,
two millions in two centuries.</p>

<p>If we make the calculation on the basis adopted by Euler, the
period of doubling will be twelve years and a half. Eight such
periods will make exactly a century, and the increase in that space
of time will be as 512:2.</p>

<p>At no era, and in no country, have we ever observed the numbers
of the human race increase with this frightful rapidity.
According to the book of Genesis, the Hebrews who entered
Egypt amounted to seventy couples;<a
href="#FN_87" id="FNa_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> and we find from the
book of Numbers that when Moses numbered the people, two
centuries afterwards, they amounted to six hundred thousand
men above twenty-one years of age,<a
href="#FN_88" id="FNa_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> which supposes a population
of two millions at least. From this we may infer that
the period of doubling was fourteen years. Statistical tables can
scarcely be admitted to control biblical facts. Shall we say that
six hundred thousand men “able to go to war” supposes a population
larger than two millions, and infer from that a period of
doubling less than Euler has calculated? In that case, we should
cast doubt either on the census of Moses or on the calculations of
Euler. All that we contend for is, that it should not be pretended
that the Hebrews multiplied with greater rapidity than it is possible
to multiply.</p>

<p>After this example, which is probably that in which <em class="e000I2">actual</em>
fecundity approximates most nearly to <em class="e000I2">virtual</em> fecundity, we have
<a id="p408" class="xxpn">[p408]</a> the case of the United States of America, where we know that the
population doubles in less than twenty-five years.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to pursue such researches further. It is sufficient
to know that in our species, as in all, the organic power of
multiplication is superior to the actual multiplication. Moreover,
it would involve a contradiction to assert that the actual surpasses
the virtual.</p>

<p>Alongside of this absolute power, which it is unnecessary to
determine more exactly, and which we may safely regard as
uniform, there exists, as we have said, another force, which limits,
compresses, suspends, to a certain extent, the action of the first,
and opposes to it obstacles of different kinds, varying with times
and places, with the occupations, the manners, the laws, or the
religion of different nations.</p>

<p>I denominate this second force <em class="e000I2">the law of limitation</em>; and it is
evident that the progress of population in each country, and in
each class, is the result of the combined action of these two
laws.</p>

<p>But in what does this law of limitation consist? We may say
in a very general way that the propagation of life is restrained or
prevented by the difficulty of sustaining life. This idea, which we
have already expressed in the terms of the formula of Malthus, it
is of importance to develop farther, for it is the essential part of
our subject.<a
href="#FN_89" id="FNa_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>Organized existences, which are indued with life, but without
feeling, are entirely passive in this struggle between the two
principles. As regards vegetables, it is strictly true that the
number of each species is limited by the means of subsistence.
The profusion of germs is infinite, but the resources of space and
territorial fertility are not so. These germs injure or destroy one
another; they fail to grow, or they take root and come to maturity
only to the extent that the soil allows of. Animals are endued
with feeling, but they would seem in general to be destitute of
foresight. They breed, increase, and multiply without regard to
the fate of their offspring. Death, premature death, alone limits
their multiplication, and maintains the equilibrium between their
numbers and their means of subsistence.</p>

<p>M. de Lamennais, in his inimitable language, thus addresses the
people:—</p>

<p>“There is room enough in the world for all, and God has made
it fertile enough to supply the wants of all.” And, further on, he
says,—“The Author of the universe has not assigned a worse
<a id="p409" class="xxpn">[p409]</a> condition to man than to the inferior animals. Are not all invited to
the rich banquet of nature? Is one alone excluded?” And, again,
he adds,—“Plants extend their roots from one field to another, in
a soil which nourishes them all, and all grow there in peace; none
of them absorbs the sap of another.”</p>

<p>In all this we see only fallacious declamation, which serves as
the basis of dangerous conclusions; and we cannot help regretting
that an eloquence so admirable should be devoted to giving popular
currency to the most fatal of errors.</p>

<p>It is not true that no plant robs another of its sap, and that all
extend their roots in the soil without injury. Hundreds of millions
of vegetable germs fall every year upon the ground, derive from it
a beginning of vitality, and then die stifled by plants stronger,
ranker, hardier than themselves. It is not true that all animals
which are born are invited to the banquet of nature, and that none
of them is excluded. Wild beasts devour one another; and of
domestic animals man destroys a countless number. Nothing, in
fact, is better calculated than this to show the existence and relations
of these two principles—that of multiplication and that of
limitation. Why have we in this country so many oxen and sheep,
notwithstanding the havoc we make? Why are there so few
bears and wolves, although we slaughter far fewer of them, and
they are so organized as to be capable of multiplying much faster?
The reason is, that man prepares subsistence for the one class of
animals, and takes it away from the other class. As regards each,
he so arranges the law of limitation as to leave more or less
latitude to the law of increase.</p>

<p>Thus, as regards both vegetables and animals, the limiting force
appears only in one form, that of <em class="e000I2">destruction</em>. But man is indued
with reason and foresight, and this new element modifies, and even
changes, the mode of action of this force, so far as he is concerned.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, in as far as he is a being provided with material
organs, or, to speak plainly, in as far as he is an animal, the law of
limitation, in the form of destruction, applies to him. It is impossible
that the numbers of men can exceed their means of
subsistence; for to assert that more men existed than had the
means of existing, would imply a contradiction. If, then, his
reason and foresight are lulled asleep, he becomes a vegetable, he
becomes a brute. In that case, he will inevitably multiply in
virtue of the great physiological law which governs all organized
nature; and, in that case, it is equally inevitable that he should
perish in virtue of that law of limitation the action of which he
has ignored. <a id="p410" class="xxpn">[p410]</a></p>

<p>But if he exercise foresight, this second law comes within the
sphere of his will. He modifies and directs it. It is, in fact, no
longer the same law. It is no longer a blind, but an intelligent
force; it is no longer a mere natural, it has become a social law.
Man is the centre in which these two principles, matter and intelligence,
meet, unite, and are blended; he belongs exclusively
neither to the one nor to the other. As regards the human race,
the <em class="e000I2">law of limitation</em> is manifested in both its aspects, and maintains
population at the necessary level by the double action of
foresight and destruction.</p>

<p>These two actions are not of uniform intensity. On the contrary,
the one is enlarged in proportion as the other is restrained.
The thing to be accomplished, the point to be reached is limitation;
and it is so more or less by means of <em class="e000I2">repression</em>, or by means
of <em class="e000I2">prevention</em>, according as man is brutish or spiritual, according as
he is more allied to matter or to mind, according as he has in him
more of vegetative or of moral life. The law may be external to
him, or internal, but it must exist somewhere.</p>

<p>We do not form a just idea of the vast domain of foresight,
which the translator of Malthus has much circumscribed, by
giving currency to that vague and inadequate expression, <em class="e000I2">moral
restraint</em> [<em class="e000I2">contrainte morale</em>], which he has still farther limited by
the definition he has given of it, namely, “The virtue which consists
in not marrying, when one has not the means of <em class="e000I2">maintaining</em>
a family, and yet living in chastity.” The obstacles which intelligent
human society opposes to possible multiplication take
many other forms besides that of moral restraint thus defined.
What means, for example, the pure and holy ignorance of early
life, the only ignorance which it is criminal to dissipate, which
every one respects, and over which the timid mother watches as
over hidden treasure? What means the modesty which succeeds
that ignorance, that mysterious defence of the young female,
which intimidates whilst it enchants her lover, and prolongs,
while it embellishes, the innocent season of courtship? The
veil which is thus interposed at first between ignorance and
truth, and then between truth and happiness, is a marvellous
thing, and in aught save this would be absurd. What means that
power of opinion which imposes such severe laws on the relations
of the sexes, stigmatizes the slightest transgression of those laws,
and visits it not only on the erring feebleness which succumbs,
but, from generation to generation, on the unhappy offspring?
What mean that sensitive honour, that rigid reserve, so generally
admired even by those who have cast it off, those institutions, those
<a id="p411" class="xxpn">[p411]</a> restraints of etiquette, those precautions of all sorts—if they are
not the action of that <em class="e000I2">law of limitation</em> manifested in an intelligent,
moral, and <em class="e000I2">preventive</em> shape—in a shape, consequently, which is
peculiar to man?</p>

<p>Let these barriers be once overturned—let mankind, in what
regards the sexes, be no longer concerned either with etiquette or
with fortune, or with the future, or with opinion, or with manners—let
men lower themselves to the rank of vegetables or animals,—can
we doubt that for the former, as for the latter, the power of
multiplication would act with a force to necessitate the instant
intervention of the <em class="e000I2">law of limitation</em>, manifested under such circumstances
in a physical, brutal, and <em class="e000I2">repressive</em> shape; that is to
say, by the action of indigence, disease, and death?</p>

<p>It is impossible to deny that, but for foresight and moral
considerations, marriage would, in most cases, be contracted at
an early age, or immediately after puberty. If we fix this
age at sixteen, and if the registers of a given country show
that marriages on an average, do not take place before four-and-twenty,
we have then eight years deducted by <em class="e000I2">the law of
limitation</em>, in its moral and preventive form, from the action of the
law of multiplication; and if we add to this figure the necessary
allowance for those who never marry, we shall be convinced that
the Creator has not degraded man to the level of the beasts that
perish, but, on the contrary, has given him the power to transform
the <em class="e000I2">repressive</em> into the <em class="e000I2">preventive</em> limitation.</p>

<p>It is singular enough that the spiritualist school and the
materialist school should have, as it were, changed sides on this
great question: the former fulminating against foresight, and
endeavouring to set up the principle of animal nature; the latter
exalting the moral part of man, and enforcing the dominion of
reason over passion and appetite.</p>

<p>The truth is, the subject is not rightly understood. Let a father
consult the most orthodox clergyman he can find as to the management
of his family, the counsels he will receive are just those which
science has exalted into <em class="e000I2">principles</em>, and which, as such, the clergyman
might probably repudiate. “Keep your daughter in strict
seclusion,” the old minister will say; “conceal from her as much
as you can the seductions of the world; cultivate, as you would a
precious flower, that holy ignorance, that heavenly modesty, which
are at once her charm and her defence. Wait until an eligible
match presents itself; and labour in the meantime to secure her
an adequate fortune. Consider that a poor and improvident marriage
brings along with it much suffering and many dangers. Recall
<a id="p412" class="xxpn">[p412]</a> those old proverbs which embody the wisdom of nations, and which
assure us that comfortable circumstances constitute the surest
guarantee of union and domestic peace. Why be in a hurry?
Would you have your daughter at five-and-twenty burdened with
a family which she cannot maintain and educate suitably to your
rank in life? Would you have her husband, feeling the inadequacy
of his income to support his family, fall into affliction and despair,
and finally, perhaps, betake himself to riot and debauchery? The
subject which now occupies you is the most important which can
come under your consideration. Weigh it well and maturely; and
avoid precipitation,” etc.</p>

<p>Suppose that the father, borrowing the language of M. de
Lamennais, should reply: “In the beginning God addressed to
all men the command to increase and multiply, and replenish
the earth and subdue it. And yet you would persuade a young
woman to live single, renounce family ties, and give up and abandon
the chaste happiness of married life, and the holy joys of
maternity; and all this for no better reason than a sordid fear of
poverty.” Think you the old clergyman would have no reply to
this?</p>

<p>God, he might say, has not commanded man to increase and
multiply without discretion and without prudence; to act with as
little regard to the future as the inferior animals. He has not indued
man with reason, in order that he may cease to use it in the
most solemn and important circumstances. He has commanded
man, no doubt, to increase, but in order to increase he must live,
and in order to live he must have the means of living. In the
command to increase, therefore, there is implied another command,
namely, to prepare for his offspring the means of subsistence.
Religion has not placed celibacy in the catalogue of crimes. So
far from that, she has ranked it as a virtue, which she honours and
sanctifies. We must not think that we violate the commandment
of God when we are preparing to fulfil it with prudence, and with
a view to the future good, happiness, and dignity of our family.</p>

<p>Now this reasoning, or reasoning of a similar kind, which we
hear repeated every day, and which regulates the conduct of every
moral and enlightened family, what is it but the application of a
general doctrine to particular cases? Or rather, what is that doctrine,
but the generalization of reasoning which applies to every
particular case? The spiritualist who repudiates, on principle, the
intervention of preventive limitation, is like the natural philosopher
who should say to us, “Act in every case as if gravity existed,
but don’t admit gravitation in theory.” <a id="p413" class="xxpn">[p413]</a></p>

<p>In our observations hitherto we have followed the theory of
Malthus; but there is one attribute of humanity to which it seems
to me that most of our authors have not assigned that importance
which it merits, and which plays an important part in the phenomena
relative to population, resolves many of the problems to which
this great question has given rise, and gives birth in the mind of
the philanthropist to a confidence and serenity which false science
had banished; this attribute, which is comprised, indeed, in the
notions of reason and foresight, is man’s <em class="e000I2">perfectibility</em>. Man is perfectible;
he is susceptible of amelioration and of deterioration; and
if, in a strict sense, he can remain stationary, he can also mount
and descend without limit the endless ladder of civilisation. This
holds true not only of individuals, but of families, nations, and
races.</p>

<p>It is from not having taken into account all the power of this
progressive principle, that Malthus has landed us in those discouraging
consequences which have rendered his theory generally
repulsive.</p>

<p>For, regarding the <em class="e000I2">preventive check</em>, in a somewhat ascetic and
not very attractive light, he could hardly attribute much force to it.
Hence he concludes that it is the <em class="e000I2">repressive</em> check which generally
operates; in other words, vice, poverty, war, crime, etc.</p>

<p>This, as I think, is an error; and we are about to see that the
<em class="e000I2">limitative</em> force presents itself not only in the shape of an effort of
chastity, an act of self-control, but also, and above all, as a condition
of happiness, an instructive movement which prevents men
from degrading themselves and their families.</p>

<p>Population, it has been said, tends to keep on a level with the
means of subsistence. I should say that, for this expression <em class="e000I2">means
of subsistence</em>, formerly in universal use, J. B. Say has substituted
another which is much more correct, namely, <em class="e000I2">means of existence</em>.
At first sight it would seem that subsistence alone enters into the
question, but it is not so. <em class="e000I2">Man does not live by bread alone</em>, and a
reference to facts shows us clearly that population is arrested, or
retarded, when the aggregate of all the means of existence, including
clothing, lodging, and other things which climate or even habit
renders necessary, come to be awanting.</p>

<p>We should say, then, that population tends to keep on a level
with the <em class="e000I2">means of existence</em>.</p>

<p>But do these means constitute something which is fixed, absolute,
and uniform? Certainly not. In proportion as civilisation
advances, the range of man’s wants is enlarged, having regard even
to simple <em class="e000I2">subsistence</em>. Regarded as a perfectible being the <em class="e000I2">means of
<a id="p414" class="xxpn">[p414]</a> existence</em>, among which we comprehend the satisfaction of moral and
intellectual, as well as physical wants, admit of as many degrees
as there are degrees in civilisation itself, in other words, of infinite
degrees. Undoubtedly, there is an inferior limit—to appease
hunger, to shelter oneself from cold to some extent, is one condition
of life, and this limit we may perceive among American
savages or European paupers. But a superior limit I know not—in
fact, there is none. Natural wants satisfied, others spring up,
which are factitious at first, if you will, but which habit renders
natural in their turn, and, after these, others still, and so on without
assignable limit.</p>

<p>At each step, then, which man takes on the road of civilisation,
his wants embrace a wider and more extended circle, and the
<em class="e000I2">means of existence</em>, the point where the laws of <em class="e000I2">multiplication</em> and
<em class="e000I2">limitation</em> meet, is removed and elevated. For although man is
susceptible of deterioration as well as of improvement, he aspires
after the one and shuns the other. His efforts all tend to maintain
the rank he has gained, and to rise still higher; and <em class="e000I2">habit</em>,
which has been so well called a second nature, performs the part
of the valves of our arterial system, by checking every retrograde
tendency. It is very natural, then, that the intelligent and moral
control which man exercises over his own multiplication should
partake of the nature of these efforts to rise, and be combined and
mixed up with his progressive tendencies.</p>

<p>The consequences which result from this organization are numerous.
We shall confine ourselves to pointing out a few of them.
First of all, we admit with the Economists that population and
the means of existence come to an equilibrium; but the last of
these terms being infinitely flexible, and varying with civilisation
and habits, we cannot admit that in comparing nations and classes,
population is proportionate to <em class="e000I2">production</em>, as J. B. Say<a
href="#FN_90" id="FNa_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> affirms, or
to <em class="e000I2">income</em>, as is represented by M. de Sismondi. And then every
advancing step of culture implies greater foresight, and the moral
and preventive check comes to neutralize the repressive one more
and more as civilisation is realized in society at large, or in one or
other of its sections. Hence it follows that each step of progress
tends to a new step in the same direction, <em class="e000I2">vires acquirit eundo</em>;
seeing that better circumstances and greater foresight engender one
another in indefinite succession. For the same reason, when men,
from whatever cause, follow a retrograde course, narrower circumstances
and want of foresight become reciprocally cause and effect,
<a id="p415" class="xxpn">[p415]</a> and retrogression and decay would have no limit had society not
been indued with that curative force, that <em class="e000I2">vis medicatrix</em>, which
Providence has vouchsafed to all organized bodies. Observe, too,
that at each step of this retrograde movement, the action of the
law of limitation in its destructive form becomes at once more
painful and more apparent. At first, it is only deterioration and
sinking in the social scale; then it is poverty, famine, disorder,
war, death;—painful but infallible teachers.</p>

<p>I should like to pause here to show how well this theory explains
facts, and how well facts in their turn justify the theory. When,
in the case of a nation or a class, the means of existence have
descended to that inferior limit at which they come to be confounded
with the means of pure subsistence, as in China, in Ireland,
and among the lowest and poorest class of every country, the
smallest oscillations of population, or of the supply of food, are
tantamount to death. In this respect facts confirm the scientific
induction. Famine has not for a long period visited Europe, and
we attribute the absence of this scourge to a multitude of causes.
The most general of these causes undoubtedly is, that the <em class="e000I2">means
of existence</em>, by reason of social progress, have risen far above the
<em class="e000I2">means of mere subsistence</em>. When years of scarcity come, we are
thus enabled to give up many enjoyments before encroaching on
the first necessaries of life. Not so in such countries as China or
Ireland, where men have nothing in the world but a little rice or
a few potatoes. When the rice or potato crops fail, they have
absolutely no means of purchasing other food.</p>

<p>A third consequence of human perfectibility we must notice
here, because it tends to modify the doctrine of Malthus in its
most afflicting phase. The formula which we have attributed to
that economist is, that “Population tends to keep on a level with
the means of subsistence.” We should say that he has gone much
farther, and that his true formula, that from which he has drawn
his most distressing conclusions, is this: “Population tends <em class="e000I2">to go
beyond</em> the means of subsistence.” Had Malthus by this simply
meant to say that in the human race the power of propagating life
is superior to the power of sustaining life, there could have been
no controversy. But this is not what he means. He affirms that,
taking into account absolute fecundity on the one hand, and, on
the other, limitation, as manifested in the two forms, repressive
and preventive, the result is still the tendency of population to go
beyond the means of subsistence.<a
href="#FN_91" id="FNa_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> This holds true of every species
<a id="p416" class="xxpn">[p416]</a> of living creatures, except the human race. Man is an intelligent
being, and can make an unlimited use of the preventive check.
He is perfectible, seeks after improvement, and shuns deterioration.
Progress is his normal state, and progress presupposes a more and
more enlightened exercise of the preventive check; and then <em class="e000I2">the
means of existence increase more rapidly than population</em>. This
effect not only flows from the principle of perfectibility, but is
confirmed by <em class="e000I2">fact</em>, since on all sides the range of satisfactions is
extended. Were it true, as Malthus asserts, that along with every
addition to the means of subsistence there is a still greater addition
to the population, the misery of our race would be fatally—inevitably—progressive;
society would begin with civilisation
and end with barbarism. The contrary is the fact; and we must
conclude that the law of limitation has had sufficient force to
restrain the multiplication of men, and keep it below the multiplication
of products.</p>

<p>It may be seen from what has been said how vast and how
difficult the question of population is. We may regret, no doubt,
that a precise formula has not been given to it, and we regret still
more that we find ourselves unable to propose one. But we may
see how repugnant the narrow limits of a dogmatic axiom are to
such a subject. It is a vain endeavour to try to express, in the
form of an inflexible equation, the relations of data so essentially
variable. Allow me to recapitulate these data.</p>

<p>(1.) <em class="e000I2">The law of increase or multiplication.</em>—The absolute, virtual,
physiological power which resides in the human race to propagate
life, apart from the consideration of the difficulty of sustaining
life. This first datum, the only one susceptible of anything like
precision, is the only one in which precision is superfluous; for
what matters it where the superior limit of multiplication is
placed in the hypothesis, if it can never be attained in the actual
condition of man, which is to sustain life with the sweat of his
brow.</p>

<p>(2.) There is a <em class="e000I2">limit</em>, then, to the law of multiplication. What
is that limit? The means of existence, it is replied. But what
are the means of existence? The aggregate of satisfactions or
enjoyments, which cannot be exactly defined. They vary with
times, places, races, ranks, manners, opinions, habits, and consequently
the limit we are in search of is shifted or displaced.</p>

<p>(3.) Last of all, it may be asked, in what consists the force which
<a id="p417" class="xxpn">[p417]</a> restrains population within this limit, which is itself movable?
As far as man is concerned, it is twofold: a force which <em class="e000I2">represses</em>,
and a force which <em class="e000I2">prevents</em>. Now, the action of the first, incapable
as it is in itself of being accurately measured, is, moreover, entirely
subordinated to the action of the second, which depends on the
degree of civilisation, on the power and prevalence of habits, on
the tendency of political and religious institutions, on the organization
of property, of labour, of family relations, etc. Between the
law of multiplication and the law of limitation, then, it is impossible
to establish an equation from which could be deduced
the actual population. In algebra <em class="e000I2">a</em> and <em class="e000I2">b</em> represent determinate
quantities which are numbered and measured, and of which we
can fix the proportions; but <em class="e000I2">means of existence</em>, <em class="e000I2">moral government
of the will</em>, <em class="e000I2">inevitable action of mortality</em>, these are the three data
of the problem of population, data which are flexible in themselves,
and which partake somewhat, moreover, of the astonishing
flexibility of the subject to which they have reference—man—that
being whom Montaigne describes as so fluctuating and so
variable. It is not surprising, then, that in desiring to give to
this equation a precision of which it is incapable, economists have
rather divided men’s minds than brought them into unison, and
this because there is not one of the terms of their formulas which
is not open to a multitude of objections, both in reasoning and in
fact.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to say something on the practical application
of the doctrine of population, for application not only elucidates
doctrine, but is the true fruit of the tree of science.</p>

<p>Labour, as we have said, is the only subject of exchange. In
order to obtain utility (unless the utility which nature gives us
gratuitously), we must be at the pains to produce it, or remunerate
another who takes the pains for us. Man creates, and can create,
nothing; he arranges, disposes, or transports things for a useful
purpose; he cannot do this without exertion, and the result of this
exertion becomes his property. If he gives away his property, he
has right to recompense, in the shape of a service which is judged
equivalent after free discussion. Such is the principle of value, of
remuneration, of exchange—a principle which is not the less true
because it is simple. Into what we denominate <em class="e000I2">products</em>, there
enter divers degrees of <em class="e000I2">natural utility</em>, and divers degrees of <em class="e000I2">artificial
utility</em>; the latter, which alone implies labour, is alone the
subject of human bargains and transactions; and without questioning
in the least the celebrated and suggestive formula of J. B.
Say, that “products are exchanged for products,” I esteem it more
<a id="p418" class="xxpn">[p418]</a> rigorously scientific to say that <em class="e000I2">labour is exchanged for labour</em>, or,
better still, that <em class="e000I2">services are exchanged for services</em>.</p>

<p>It must not be inferred from this, however, that quantities of
labour are exchanged for each other in the ratio of their duration
or of their intensity; or that the man who transfers to another an
hour’s labour, or even the man who labours with the greatest
intensity, who, as it were, pushes the needle of the dynamometer
up to 100 degrees, can always stipulate for an equal effort in
return. <em class="e000I2">Duration</em> and <em class="e000I2">intensity</em> are, no doubt, two of the elements
taken into account in the appreciation of labour; but they are not
the only ones; for we must consider, besides, that labour may be
more or less repugnant, dangerous, difficult, intelligent, that it may
imply more or less foresight, and may even be more or less
successful. When transactions are free, and property completely
secured, each has entire control over his own labour, and, consequently,
need only dispose of it at his own price. The limit to
his compliance is the point at which it is more advantageous
to reserve his labour than to exchange it; the limit to his exactions
is the point at which the other party to the bargain finds it
his interest not to make the exchange.</p>

<p>There are in Society as many <em class="e000I2">strata</em>, if I may use the expression,
as there are degrees in the scale of remuneration. The worst
remunerated of all labour is that which approximates most nearly
to brute force. This is an arrangement of Providence which is
just, useful, and inevitable. The mere manual labourer soon
reaches that <em class="e000I2">limit to his exactions</em> of which I have just spoken, for
everybody can perform this kind of muscular automatic labour;
and the <em class="e000I2">limit to his compliance</em> is also soon reached, for he is incapable
of the intelligent labour which his own wants require.
<em class="e000I2">Duration</em> and <em class="e000I2">intensity</em>, which are attributes of matter, are the sole
elements of the remuneration of this species of unskilled material
labour; and that is the reason why it is usually paid <em class="e000I2">by the day</em>.
All industrial progress consists in this, namely, in replacing in
each product a certain amount of <em class="e000I2">artificial</em>, and, consequently,
<em class="e000I2">onerous utility</em>, by the same amount of <em class="e000I2">natural</em>, and, therefore,
<em class="e000I2">gratuitous utility</em>. Hence it follows that if there be one class of
society more interested than another in free competition, it is the
labouring class. What would be the fate of these men if natural
agents, and new processes and instruments of production, were not
brought continually, by means of competition, to confer <em class="e000I2">gratuitously</em>,
on all, the results of their co-operation? The mere day-labourer
knows not how to make available in the production of
the commodities he has occasion for, heat, gravitation, or elasticity;
<a id="p419" class="xxpn">[p419]</a> nor can he discover the processes, nor does he possess the instruments,
by which these forces are rendered useful. When such
discoveries are new, the labour of inventors, who are men of
the highest intelligence, is well remunerated; in other words, that
labour is the equivalent of a large amount of rude unskilled labour;
or, again, to change the expression, his product is <em class="e000I2">dear</em>. But competition
interposes, the product falls in price, the co-operation of
natural agents is no longer profitable to the producer, but to the
consumer, and the labour which has made them available approximates,
as regards remuneration, to that labour which is estimated
by mere duration. Thus, the common fund of gratuitous wealth
goes on constantly increasing. Products of every kind tend, day
after day, to become again invested,—and they are in reality invested,—with
that condition of <em class="e000I2">gratuitousness</em> which characterizes
our supply of air, and light, and water. The general level of
humanity thus continues to rise, and to equalize itself; and, apart
from the operation of the law of population, the lowest class of
society is that whose amelioration is virtually the most rapid.
We have said, apart from the operation of the law of population;
and this brings us back to the subject we are now examining.</p>

<p>Figure to yourself a basin into which an orifice which is constantly
enlarging admits a constantly increasing supply of water.
If we look only to this circumstance, we conclude that the level of
the water in the basin is continually rising. But if the sides of
the basin are flexible, and capable of contracting and expanding, it
is evident that the height of the water will depend on the manner
in which this new circumstance is combined with the other. The
level of the water will sink, however great may be the supply running
into the basin, if the capacity of the basin itself is enlarged
still more rapidly. It will rise, if the circle of the reservoir is
enlarged only proportionally and very slowly, higher still if it
remain fixed, and highest of all if it is narrowed or contracted.</p>

<p>This is a picture of the social class whose destinies we are now
considering, and which constitutes, it must be allowed, the great
mass of mankind. The water which comes into the basin through
the elastic orifice represents their remuneration, or the objects
fitted to supply their wants and to sustain life. The flexibility of
the sides of the basin represents the movement of population. It
is certain<a
href="#FN_92" id="FNa_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> that the means of existence overtake our population in
a constantly increasing progression, but then it is equally certain
that their numbers may increase in a still superior progression.
The life of this class, then, will be more or less happy, more or less
<a id="p420" class="xxpn">[p420]</a> comfortable, according as the law of limitation, in its moral, intelligent,
and preventive form, shall circumscribe, to a greater or less
extent, the absolute law of multiplication. There is a limit to the
increase of the numbers of the working class. That limit is the
point at which the progressive fund of remuneration becomes insufficient
for their maintenance. But there is no limit to their
possible amelioration, because of the two elements which constitute
it, the one, wealth, is constantly increasing, and the other, population,
is under their own control.</p>

<p>What we have just said with reference to the lowest social
grade, the class of mere manual labourers, is applicable also to
each of the superior grades, when classified in relation to one
another, in an inverse proportion, so to speak, to the rudeness and
materiality of their occupations. Taking each class simply by
itself, all are subjected to the same general laws. In all there is a
struggle between the physiological power of multiplication, and the
moral power of limitation. The only respect in which one class
differs from another is with reference to the point where these two
forces meet, the height to which the limit between the two laws
may be raised by remuneration or be fixed by the habits of the
labourers—this limit we have denominated the <em class="e000I2">means of existence</em>.</p>

<p>But if we consider the various classes, no longer each by itself,
but in their reciprocal relations, I think we can discern the influence
of two principles acting in an inverse sense, and this without
doubt is the explanation of the actual condition of mankind. We
have shown how all the economic phenomena, and especially the
law of competition, tend to an equality of conditions. Theoretically
this appears to us incontestable. Seeing that no natural
advantage, no ingenious process, none of the instruments by which
such processes are made available, can remain permanently with
producers, as such; and seeing that the results of such natural
advantages or discoveries, by an irresistible law of Providence,
tend to become the common, gratuitous, and, consequently, equal,
patrimony of all men, it is evident that the poorest class is the one
which derives the greatest <em class="e000I2">relative</em> profit from this admirable
arrangement of the laws of the social economy. Just as the poor
man is as liberally treated as the rich man with reference to the air
he breathes, in the same way he becomes equal to the rich man, as
regards all that portion of the value of commodities which progress
is constantly annihilating. Essentially, then, the human race has a
very marked tendency towards <em class="e000I2">equality</em>. I do not speak of a tendency
of aspiration, but a tendency of realization. And yet equality is not
realized, or is realized so slowly, that in comparing two distant
<a id="p421" class="xxpn">[p421]</a> epochs we are scarcely sensible of the progress. Indeed we are
so little sensible of it, that many able men deny it altogether,
although in this they are certainly mistaken. Now, what is the
cause which retards this fusion of classes on a common and progressive
level?</p>

<p>In searching for the cause we need not, I think, look farther
than the various degrees of <em class="e000I2">foresight</em> which each class exercises as
regards the increase of population. The law of limitation, as has
been already said, in as far as it is <em class="e000I2">moral</em> and <em class="e000I2">preventive</em>, we have
under our own control. Man, as we have also said, is perfectible,
and in proportion to his progress in improvement, he pays a more
intelligent regard to this law. The superior classes, then, in proportion
as they are more enlightened, are led to make greater
exertions, and submit to greater sacrifices, in order to maintain
their respective numbers on a level with the means of existence
which their position in society demands.</p>

<p>Were we sufficiently far advanced in statistics, we should probably
have this theoretical deduction converted into certainty, and
have it proved by fact that marriages are less hasty and precocious
among the higher than among the lower classes of society. If it
be so, it is easy to see that in the general market, to which all
classes bring their respective services, and in which labour of
every kind is the subject of exchange, unskilled labour will be
supplied in greater abundance than skilled labour; and this
explains the continuance of that inequality of conditions, which so
many, and such powerful, causes of another kind tend constantly
to efface.</p>

<p>The theory which we have now briefly explained leads us to the
practical conclusion that the best forms of philanthropy, the best
social institutions, are those which, while acting in accordance with
the Providential plan, as revealed to us by the social harmonies—I
mean the plan of progressive equality—shall cause to descend
among all ranks of society, and especially the lowest ranks, knowledge,
discretion, morality, and foresight.</p>

<p>I say institutions, because, in fact, foresight results as much
from the necessities of position as from resolutions purely intellectual.
There are certain organizations of property, or, I should
rather say, of industry, which are more favourable than others
to what economists call a knowledge of the market, and, consequently,
to <em class="e000I2">foresight</em>. It seems certain, for example, that <em class="e000I2">métayage</em>
is much more efficacious than <em class="e000I2">fermage</em><a
href="#FN_93" id="FNa_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> (the latter necessitating
<a id="p422" class="xxpn">[p422]</a> the employment of day labourers) in interposing a preventive
obstacle to the exuberance of population among the lower classes.
A family of <em class="e000I2">métayers</em> is in a much more likely situation than a
family of day-labourers to experience the inconveniences of hasty
marriages and improvident multiplication.</p>

<p>I have also used the expression, “forms of philanthropy.” In
fact, almsgiving may effect a local and present good, but its
influence must be limited even where it is not prejudicial to the
happiness of the labouring classes; for it does not develop, but,
on the contrary, may paralyze, that virtue which is most fitted to
elevate the condition of the labourer, namely, <em class="e000I2">foresight</em>. To
disseminate sound ideas, and, above all, to induce those habits
which mark a certain degree of self-respect, is the greatest and
most permanent good which we can confer upon the lower
orders.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">means of existence</em>, we cannot too often repeat, do not constitute
a fixed quantity; they depend upon the state of manners, of
opinion, and of habits. Whatever rank a man holds in the social
scale, he has as much repugnance to descend from the position to
which he has been accustomed as can be felt by men of an inferior
grade. Perhaps there is even greater suffering in the mind of the
aristocrat, the noble scions of whose house are lost among the
<em class="e000I2">bourgeoisie</em>, than in that of the citizen whose sons become manual
labourers, or in that of manual labourers whose children are
reduced to pauperism. The <em class="e000I2">habit</em>, then, of enjoying a certain
amount of material prosperity and a certain rank in life, is the
strongest stimulant to the exercise of foresight; and if the
working classes shall once raise themselves to the possession of a
higher amount of enjoyment, and be unwilling again to descend
in the social scale, then, in order to maintain themselves in
that position, and preserve wages in keeping with their new
habits, they must employ the infallible means of preventive
limitation.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that I regard as one of the finest manifestations
of philanthropy the resolution which appears to have been
taken in England by many of the proprietors and manufacturers,
to pull down cottages of mud and thatch, and substitute for them
brick houses, neat, spacious, well lighted, well aired, and conveniently
furnished. Were such a measure to become general, it
<a id="p423" class="xxpn">[p423]</a> would elevate the tone of the working classes. It would convert
into real wants what are nowadays regarded as comparative
luxuries; it would raise that limit which we have denominated
the <em class="e000I2">means of existence</em>, and, by consequence, the <em class="e000I2">standard of remuneration</em>,
from its present low rate. And why not? The lower
orders in civilized countries are much above the lower orders
among savages. They have raised themselves so far; and why
should they not raise themselves still more?</p>

<p>We must not, however, deceive ourselves on this subject; progress
can be but very slow, since to some extent it must be <em class="e000I2">general</em>.
In certain parts of the world it might perhaps be realized rapidly
if the people exercised no influence over each other; but this is
not so. There is a great law of solidarity for the human race, in
progress as well as in deterioration. If in England, for example,
the condition of the working classes were sensibly improved, in
consequence of a general rise of wages, French industry would
have more chances of surpassing its rival, and by its advance
would moderate the progressive movement manifested on the
other side of the Channel. It would seem that, beyond certain
limits, Providence has not designed that one people should rise
above another. And thus, in the great aggregate of human
society, as in its most minute details, we always find that admirable
and inflexible forces tend to confer, in the long-run, on
the masses, individual or collective advantages, and to bring back
all temporary manifestations of superiority to a common level,
which, like that of the ocean when the tide flows, is always
equalizing itself and always advancing.</p>

<p>To conclude, perfectibility, which is the distinctive characteristic
of man, being given, and the action of competition and the law of
limitation being known, the fate of the human race, as regards its
worldly destinies, may be thus summed up:—1<em class="e000I2">st</em>, Simultaneous
elevation of all the social ranks, or of the general level of
humanity; 2<em class="e000I2">d</em>, Indefinite approximation of conditions, and successive
annihilation of the distances which separate classes, as
far as consistent with absolute justice; 3<em class="e000I2">d</em>, Relative diminution of
the numbers of the lowest and highest orders, and extension of
intermediate classes. It may be said that these laws must lead to
absolute equality. No more than the constant approximation of
asymptotical lines can finally load to their junction. . . . .

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This chapter, the greater part of which was written in 1846, does not perhaps
express with sufficient clearness the author’s opposition to the ideas of Malthus. <a id="p424" class="xxpn">[p424]</a></p>

<p>Bastiat explains here very clearly the unperceived and naturally preventive
action of individual motive,—the progressive desire for happiness, the ambition of
men to better their condition; and the habit which causes each to regard the competence
he has gained as a necessity,—<em class="e000I2">an inferior limit of the means of existence</em>,
below which no one would willingly see his family reduced. But this is in some
measure the negative view of the law. It only shows that in every society founded
upon the institutions of property and family, population ceases to be a <em class="e000I2">danger</em>.</p>

<p>It remains to be shown that <em class="e000I2">population is in itself a force</em>, and to prove the
necessary increase of productive power which results from the density of population.
This, as the author has himself said (p. 113), is the important element
neglected by Malthus, and which discloses harmony, where Malthus discovered
discordance.</p>

<p>From the premises indicated in the chapter <em class="e000I2">on Exchange</em>, premises which he proposed
to himself to develop in treating of population, the conclusion which Bastiat
wished to draw was decidedly anti-Malthusian. We find it stated in one of the last
notes which he wrote, and he recommends its being insisted on:—</p>

<p>“In the chapter on Exchange it has been demonstrated that, in a state of
isolation, man’s wants surpass his faculties, and that, in the social state, his
faculties surpass his wants.</p>

<p>“This excess of faculties over wants proceeds from exchange, which is—association
of efforts—separation of occupations.</p>

<p>“Thence an action and a reaction of causes and effects, in a circle of progress
which is infinite.</p>

<p>“The superiority of faculties over wants, creating for each generation an excess
of wealth, permits it to rear a more numerous offspring. A generation more numerous
implies a better and more marked separation of occupations, and a new degree
of superiority given to faculties over wants.</p>

<p>“This exhibits an admirable harmony.</p>

<p>“Thus, at a given epoch, the general aggregate of wants being represented by
100, and that of faculties by 110, the excess of 10 is thus divided,—5, for example,
goes to the amelioration of men’s condition, to the provoking of wants of a more
elevated character, to the development of self-respect, etc.,—and 5 to the augmentation
of their numbers.</p>

<p>“The wants of the second generation are 110,—namely, 5 more in quantity, and
5 more in quality.</p>

<p>“But for that very reason (for the double reason of the more complete physical,
intellectual, and moral development, and of the greater density of population, which
renders production more easy), the faculties have also increased in power. They
will be represented, for example, by the figures 120 or 130.</p>

<p>“New excess, new division, etc.</p>

<p>“And let us not fear the <em class="e000I2">trop plein</em>. The
elevation of wants, which is nothing else than the sentiment of
dignity, is a natural limit. . . . .”</p>

<h2 title="XVII. Private and Public Services">
<a id="XVII"></a>XVII.<br />
PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SERVICES.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
<em class="e000I2">Services</em>
are exchanged for <em class="e000I2">services</em>.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">equivalence</em> of <em class="e000I2">services</em> results from voluntary exchange, and
the free bargaining and discussion which precede it.</p>

<p>In other words, each <em class="e000I2">service</em> rendered to society is <em class="e000I2">worth</em> as much
as any other service of which it constitutes the equivalent, provided
<em class="e000I2">supply</em> and <em class="e000I2">demand</em> are in all respects perfectly <em class="e000I2">free</em>.</p>

<p>It is in vain to carp and refine upon it; it is impossible to conceive
the idea of value without associating with it the idea of
liberty.</p>

<p>When the equivalence of services is not impaired by violence,
restriction, or fraud, we may pronounce that <em class="e000I2">justice</em> prevails.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that the human race will then have reached
the extreme limit of improvement, for liberty does not exclude the
errors of individual appreciations—man is frequently the dupe of
his judgments and passions, nor are his desires always arranged
in the most rational order. We have seen that the value of a service
may be appreciated without there being any reasonable proportion
between its value and its utility; and this arises from our
giving certain desires precedence over others It is the progress of
intelligence, of good sense, and of manners, which establishes this
fair and just proportion by putting each service, if I may so express
myself, in its right moral place. A frivolous object, a puerile show,
an immoral pleasure, may have much value in one country, and
may be despised or repudiated in another. The equivalence of
services, then, is a different thing from a just appreciation of their
utility. But still, as regards this, it is liberty and the sense of responsibility
which correct and improve our tastes, our desires, our
satisfactions, and our appreciations.</p>

<p>In all countries of the world, there exists one class of services,
which, as regards the manner in which they are distributed and
<a id="p426" class="xxpn">[p426]</a> remunerated, accomplishes an evolution quite different from that
of private or free services. I allude to <em class="e000I2">public services</em>.</p>

<p>When a want assumes a character so universal and so uniform
that one can describe it as a <em class="e000I2">public want</em>, it may be convenient for
those people who form part of the same agglomeration (be it district,
province, or country) to provide for the satisfaction of that
want by collective action, or a collective delegation of power. In
that case, they name functionaries whose duty it is to render to
the community, and distribute among them, the service in question,
and whose remuneration they provide for by a contribution which
is, at least in principle, proportionate to the means of each member
of the society.</p>

<p>In reality, the primordial elements of the social economy are not
necessarily impaired or set aside by this peculiar form of exchange,—above
all, when the consent of all parties is assumed. It still
resolves itself into a transmission of efforts, a transmission of services.
These functionaries labour to satisfy the wants of the taxpayers,
and the taxpayers labour to satisfy the wants of the
functionaries. The relative value of their reciprocal services is
determined by a method which we shall have afterwards to examine;
but the essential principles of the exchange, speaking in
the abstract at least, remain intact.</p>

<p>Those authors, then, are wrong, who, influenced by their dislike
of unjust and oppressive taxes, regard as <em class="e000I2">lost</em> all values devoted to
the public service.<a
href="#FN_94" id="FNa_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> This unqualified condemnation will not bear
examination. In so far as <em class="e000I2">loss</em> or <em class="e000I2">gain</em> is concerned, the public
service, scientifically considered, differs in nothing from <em class="e000I2">private
service</em>. Whether I protect my field myself, or pay a man for
protecting it or pay the State for causing it to be protected, there
is always a sacrifice with a corresponding benefit. In both ways,
no doubt, I lose this amount of labour, but I gain security. It is
not a loss, but an exchange.</p>

<p>Will it be said that I give a material object, and receive in
return a thing without body or form? This is just to fall back
upon the erroneous theory of value. As long as we attribute value
to matter, not to services, we must regard every public service as
being without value, or lost. Afterwards, when we begin to shift
<a id="p427" class="xxpn">[p427]</a> about between what is true and what is false, on the subject of
value, we shift about between what is true and what is false on the
subject of taxation.</p>

<p>If taxation is not necessarily a loss, still less is it necessarily
spoliation.<a
href="#FN_95" id="FNa_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> No doubt, in modern societies, spoliation by means of
taxation is perpetrated on a great scale. We shall afterwards see
that it is one of the most active of those causes which disturb the
equivalence of services and the harmony of interests. But the
best way of combating and eradicating the abuses of taxation, is to
steer clear of that exaggeration which would represent all taxation
as being <em class="e000I2">essentially</em>, and <em class="e000I2">in itself</em>, spoliation.</p>

<p>Thus, considered in themselves, in their own nature, in their
normal state, and apart from abuses, <em class="e000I2">public services</em>, like <em class="e000I2">private
services</em>, resolve themselves into pure exchanges.</p>

<p>But the modes in which, in these two forms of exchange, services
are compared, bargained for, and transmitted, the modes in which
they are brought to an equilibrium or equivalence, and in which
their relative value is manifested, are so different in themselves,
and in their effects, that the reader will bear with me if I dwell
at some length on this difficult subject, one of the most interesting
which can be presented to the consideration of the economist and
the statesman. It is here, in truth, that we have the connecting
link between politics and social economy. It is here that we discover
the origin and tendency of the most fatal error which has
ever infected the science, the error of confounding society with
Government; society being the grand <em class="e000I2">whole</em>, which includes both
private and public services, and Government, the fraction which
includes public services alone.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when, by following the teaching of Rousseau, and
his apt scholars the French republicans, we employ indifferently
the words Government and Society, we pronounce, implicitly,
beforehand, and without examination, that the State can and
ought to absorb private exertion altogether, along with individual
liberty and responsibility. We conclude that all private
services ought to be converted into public services. We
conclude that the social order is a conventional and contingent
fact which owes its existence to the law. We pronounce the lawgiver
<a id="p428" class="xxpn">[p428]</a> omnipotent, and mankind powerless, as having forfeited their
rights.</p>

<p>In fact, we see public services, or governmental action, extended
or restrained according to circumstances of time and place, from
the Communism of Sparta, or the Missions of Paraguay, to the
individualism of the United States, and the centralization of
France.</p>

<p>The question which presents itself on the threshold of Politics,
as a science, then, is this:—</p>

<p>What are the services which should remain in the domain of
private activity? And what are the services which should fall
within that of public or collective activity?</p>

<p>The problem, then, is this:—</p>

<p>In the great circle called <em class="e000I2">society</em>, to trace accurately the inscribed
circle called <em class="e000I2">government</em>.</p>

<p>It is evident that this problem belongs to Political Economy,
since it implies the comparative examination of two very different
forms of exchange.</p>

<p>This problem once solved, there remains another, namely, what
is the best organization of public services? This last belongs to
pure Politics, and we shall not enter upon it.</p>

<p>Let us examine, then, first of all, the essential differences by
which public and private services are characterized, which is a preliminary
inquiry necessary to enable us to fix accurately the line
which should divide them.</p>

<p>The whole of the preceding portion of this work has been
devoted to exhibit the evolution of <em class="e000I2">private services</em>. We have
had a glimpse of it in this formal or tacit proposition: <em class="e000I2">Do this for
me, and I shall do that for you</em>; which implies, whether as regards
what we give away or what we receive, a double and reciprocal
consent. We can form no correct notion, then, of barter, exchange,
appreciation, value, apart from the consideration of <em class="e000I2">liberty</em>,
nor of liberty apart from <em class="e000I2">responsibility</em>. In having recourse to
exchange, each party consults, on his own responsibility, his
wants, his tastes, his desires, his faculties, his affections, his convenience,
his entire situation; and we have nowhere denied that
to the exercise of free will is attached the possibility of error, the
possibility of a foolish and irrational choice. The error belongs
not to exchange, but to human imperfection; and the remedy can
only reside in responsibility itself (that is to say, in liberty), seeing
that liberty is the source of all experience. To establish restraint
in the business of exchange, to destroy free will under the pretext
that man may err, would be no improvement, unless it were
<a id="p429" class="xxpn">[p429]</a> first proved to us that the agent who organizes the restraint does
not himself participate in the imperfection of our nature, and is
subject neither to the passions nor to the errors of other men.
On the contrary, is it not evident that this would be, not only to
displace responsibility, but to annihilate it, at least as regards all
that is valuable in its remunerative, retributive, experimental, corrective,
and, consequently, progressive character? Again, we
have seen that free exchanges, or services voluntarily rendered
and received, are, under the action of competition, continually
extending the co-operation of gratuitous forces, as compared with
that of onerous forces, the domain of community as compared with
the domain of property, and thus we have come to recognise in
liberty that power which promotes progressive equality, or social
harmony.</p>

<p>We have no need to describe the form which exchanges assume
when thus left free. Restraint takes a thousand shapes; liberty
has but one. I repeat once more, that the free and voluntary
transmission of private services is defined by the simple words:
“Give me this, and I will give you that; do this for me, and I
shall do that for you”—<em class="e000I2">Do ut des; facio ut facias</em>.<a
href="#FN_96" id="FNa_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p>The same thing does not hold with reference to the exchange of
<em class="e000I2">public services</em>. Here <em class="e000I2">constraint</em> is to a certain extent inevitable,
and we encounter an infinite number of different forms, from absolute
despotism, down to the universal and direct intervention of
all the citizens.</p>

<p>Although this ideal order of things has never been anywhere
actually realized, and perhaps may never be so, except in a very
elusory shape, we may nevertheless assume its existence. What
is the object of our inquiry? We are seeking to discover the
modifications which <em class="e000I2">services</em> undergo when they enter the public
domain; and for the purposes of science we must discard the consideration
of individual and local acts of violence, and regard the
public service simply as such, and as existing under the most legitimate
circumstances. In a word, we must investigate the transformation
which it undergoes from the single circumstance of its
having become public, apart from the causes which have made
it so, and of the abuses which may mingle with the means of
execution.</p>

<p>The process is this:—</p>

<p>The citizens name mandatories. These mandatories meet, and
decide, by a majority, that a certain class of wants—the want of
education, for example—can no longer be supplied by free exertions
<a id="p430" class="xxpn">[p430]</a> and free exchanges made by the citizens themselves, and they decree
that education shall be provided by functionaries specially
delegated and intrusted with the work of instruction. So much
for the service <em class="e000I2">rendered</em>. As regards the services <em class="e000I2">received</em>, as the
State has secured the time and abilities of these new functionaries
for the benefit of the citizens, it must also take from the citizens a
part of their means for the benefit of the functionaries. This is
effected by an assessment or general contribution.</p>

<p>In all civilized communities such contributions are paid in
money. It is scarcely necessary to say that behind this money
there is labour. In reality, it is a payment in kind. In reality,
the citizens work for the functionaries, and the functionaries work
for the citizens, just as, in free and private transactions, the citizens
work for one another.</p>

<p>We set down this observation here, in order to elude a very
widely-spread sophism which springs from the consideration of
money. We hear it frequently said that money received by public
functionaries falls back like refreshing rain on the citizens. And
we are led to infer that this rain is a second benefit added to that
which results from the service. Reasoning in this way, people
have come to justify the existence of functions the most parasitical.
They do not consider that if this service had remained in
the domain of private activity, the money (which, in place of going
to the treasury, and from the treasury to the functionaries) would
have gone directly to men who voluntarily undertook the duty,
and in the same way would have fallen back like rain upon the
masses. This sophism will not stand examination, when we extend
our regards beyond the mere circulation of money, and see that at
the bottom it is labour exchanged for labour, services for services.
In public life, it may happen that functionaries receive services
without rendering any in return; and then there is a loss entailed
on the taxpayer, however we may delude ourselves with reference
to this circulation of specie.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, let us resume our analysis:—</p>

<p>We have here, then, an exchange under a new form. Exchange
includes two terms—<em class="e000I2">to give</em>, and <em class="e000I2">to receive</em>. Let us inquire then
how this transaction, which from being private has become public,
is affected in the double point of view of services <em class="e000I2">rendered</em> and services
<em class="e000I2">received</em>.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is proved beyond doubt that public services
always, or nearly always, extinguish, in law or in fact, private services
of the same nature. The State, when it undertakes a service,
generally takes care to decree that no other body shall render it,
<a id="p431" class="xxpn">[p431]</a> more especially if one of its objects be to derive a revenue from it.
Witness the cases of postage, tobacco, gunpowder, etc. Did the
State not take this precaution, the result would be the same.
What manufacturer would engage to render to the public a service
which the State renders for nothing? We scarcely meet
with any one who seeks a livelihood by teaching law or medicine
privately, by the formation of high-roads, by rearing thoroughbred
horses, by founding schools of arts and design, by clearing
lands in Algeria, by establishing museums, etc. And the reason
is this, that the public will not go to purchase what the State gives
it for nothing. As M. de Cormenin has said, the trade of the
shoemakers would soon be put an end to, even were it declared
inviolable by the first article of the constitution, if Government
took it into its head to furnish shoes to everybody gratuitously.</p>

<p>In truth, in the word <em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>, as applied to public services,
there lurks the grossest and most puerile of sophisms.</p>

<p>For my own part, I wonder at the extreme gullibility of the
public in allowing itself to be taken in with this word. What! it
is said, do you not wish gratuitous education? gratuitous studs?</p>

<p>Certainly I wish them, and I should also wish to have gratuitous
food and gratuitous lodging—if it were possible.</p>

<p>But there is nothing really gratuitous but what costs nothing to
any one. Now public services cost something to everybody; and
it is just because everybody has paid for them beforehand that they
no longer cost anything to the man who receives the benefit. The
man who has paid his share of the general contribution will take
good care not to pay for the service a second time by calling in
the aid of private industry.</p>

<p>Public service is thus substituted for private service. It adds
nothing either to the general labour of the nation or to its wealth.
It accomplishes by means of functionaries, what would have been
effected by private industry. The question, then, is, Which of
these arrangements entails the greatest amount of inconvenience?
and the solution of that question is the object of the present
chapter.</p>

<p>The moment the satisfaction of a want becomes the subject of a
public service, it is withdrawn, to a great extent, from the domain
of individual liberty and responsibility. The individual is no
longer free to procure that satisfaction in his own way, to purchase
what he chooses and when he chooses, consulting only his
own situation and resources, his means, and his moral appreciations;
nor can he any longer exercise his discretion in regard
to the order in which he may judge it reasonable to provide for
<a id="p432" class="xxpn">[p432]</a> his various wants. Whether he will or not, his wants are now
supplied by the public, and he obtains from society, not that
measure of service which he judges useful, as he did in the case
of private services, but the amount of service which the Government
thinks it proper to furnish, whatever be its quantity and
quality. Perhaps he is in want of bread to satisfy his hunger,
and part of the bread of which he has such urgent need is withheld
from him, in order to furnish him with education, or with
theatrical entertainments, which he does not want. He ceases to
exercise free control over the satisfaction of his own wants, and
having no longer any feeling of responsibility, he no longer
exerts his intelligence. Foresight has become as useless to him
as experience. He is less his own master; he is deprived, to
some extent, of free will, he is less progressive, he is less a
man. Not only does he no longer judge for himself in a particular
case; he has got out of the habit of judging for himself
in any case. The moral torpor which thus gains upon him,
gains, for the same reason, on all his fellow-citizens, and in this
way we have seen whole nations abandon themselves to a fatal
inaction.<a
href="#FN_97" id="FNa_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>As long as a certain class of wants and of corresponding satisfactions
remains in the domain of liberty, each, in so far as this
class is concerned, lays down a rule for himself, which he can
modify at pleasure. This would seem to be both natural and
fair, seeing that no two men find themselves in exactly the same
situation; nor is there any one man whose circumstances do not
vary from day to day. In this way, all the human faculties
remain in exercise, comparison, judgment, foresight. In this
way, too, every good and judicious resolution brings its recompense
and every error its chastisement; and experience, that rude
<a id="p433" class="xxpn">[p433]</a> substitute for foresight, so far at least fulfils its mission that society
goes on improving.</p>

<p>But when the service becomes public, all individual rules of
conduct and action disappear, and are mixed up and generalized
in a written, coercive, and inflexible law, which is the same for all,
which makes no allowance for particular situations, and strikes the
noblest faculties of human nature with numbness and torpor.</p>

<p>If State intervention deprive us of all self-government with
reference to the services we receive from the public, it deprives
us in a still more marked degree of all control with reference to
the services which we render in return. This counterpart, this
supplementary element in the exchange, is likewise a deduction
from our liberty, and is regulated by uniform inflexible rules, by a
law passed beforehand, made operative by force, and of which we
cannot get rid. In a word, as the services which the State renders
us are imposed upon us, those which it demands in return are also
imposed upon us, and in all languages take the name of <em class="e000I2">imposts</em>.</p>

<p>And here a multitude of theoretical difficulties and inconveniences
present themselves; for practically the State surmounts all
obstacles by means of an armed force, which is the necessary
sequence of every law. But, to confine ourselves to the theory,
the transformation of a private into a public service gives rise to
these grave questions:—</p>

<p>Will the State under all circumstances demand from each
citizen an amount of taxation <em class="e000I2">equivalent</em> to the services rendered?
This were but fair; and this <em class="e000I2">equivalence</em> is exactly the result which
we almost infallibly obtain from free and voluntary transactions,
and the bargaining which precedes them. If the design of the
State, then, is to realize this <em class="e000I2">equivalence</em> (which is only justice), it
is not worth while taking this class of services out of the domain
of private activity. But equivalence is never thought of, nor can
it be. We do not stand higgling and chaffering with public
functionaries. The law proceeds on general rules, and cannot
make conditions applicable to each individual case. At the
utmost, and when it is conceived in a spirit of justice, it aims at
a sort of average equivalence, an approximate equivalence, between
the two services exchanged. Two principles—namely, the proportionality
and the progression of taxation—have appeared in many
respects to carry this approximation to its utmost limit. But the
slightest reflection will convince us that proportional taxation
cannot, any more than progressive taxation, realize the exact
equivalence of services exchanged. Public services, after having
forcibly deprived the citizens of their liberty, as regards services
<a id="p434" class="xxpn">[p434]</a> both rendered and received, have, then, this farther fault of unsettling
the value of these services.</p>

<p>Another, and not less grave, inconvenience is, that they destroy,
or at least displace, responsibility. To man responsibility is all-important.
It is his mover and teacher, his rewarder and avenger.
Without it man is no longer a free agent, he is no longer perfectible,
no longer a moral being, he learns nothing, he is nothing. He abandons
himself to inaction, and becomes a mere unit of the herd.</p>

<p>If it be a misfortune that the sense of responsibility should be
extinguished in the individual, it is no less a misfortune that it
should be developed in the State in an exaggerated form. Man,
however degraded, has always as much light left him as to see the
quarter from whence good or evil comes to him; and when the
State assumes the charge of all, it becomes responsible for all.
Under the dominion of such artificial arrangements, a people which
suffers can only lay the blame on its Government, and its only
remedy, its only policy, is to overturn it. Hence an inevitable
succession of revolutions. I say inevitable, for under such a <em class="e000I2">régime</em>
the people must necessarily suffer; and the reason of it is that
public services, besides disturbing and unsettling values, which is
injustice, lead also to the destruction of wealth, which is ruin;
ruin and injustice, suffering and discontent—four fatal causes of
effervescence in society, which, combined with the displacement
of responsibility, cannot fail to bring about political convulsions
like those from which we have been suffering for more than half
a century.</p>

<p>Without desiring to indulge in digressions, I cannot help remarking,
that when things are organized in this fashion, when
Government has assumed gigantic proportions by the successive
transformation of free and voluntary transactions into public
services, it is to be feared that revolutions, which constitute in
themselves so great an evil, have not even the advantage of being
a remedy, unless the remedy is forced upon us by experience.
The displacement of responsibility has perverted public opinion.
The people, accustomed to expect everything from the State, never
accuse Government of doing too much, but of not doing enough.
They overturn it, and replace it by another, to which they do not
say, “Do less,” but “Do more;” so that, having fallen into one
ditch, they set to work to dig another.</p>

<p>At length the moment comes when their eyes are opened, and
it is felt to be necessary to curtail the prerogatives and responsibilities
of Government. Here we are stopped by difficulties of
another kind. Functionaries alleging <em class="e000I2">vested rights</em> rise up and
<a id="p435" class="xxpn">[p435]</a> coalesce, and we are averse to bear hard on numerous interests to
which we have given an artificial existence. On the other hand,
the people have forgotten how to act for themselves. At the
moment they have succeeded in reconquering the liberty of which
they were in quest, they are afraid of it, and repudiate it. Offer
them a free and voluntary system of education:<a
href="#FN_98" id="FNa_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> they believe
that all science is about to be extinguished. Offer them religious
liberty: they believe that atheism is about to invade us,—so often
has it been dinned into their ears that all religion, all wisdom, all
science, all learning, all morality, resides in the State or flows
from it.</p>

<p>But we shall find a place for such reflections elsewhere, and
must now return to the argument.</p>

<p>We set ourselves to discover the true part which competition
plays in the development of wealth, and we found that it consisted
in giving an advantage in the first instance to the producer;
then turning this advantage to the profit of the community;
and constantly enlarging the domain of the gratuitous,
and consequently the domain of equality.</p>

<p>But when private services become public services, they escape
competition, and this fine harmony is suspended. In fact, the
functionary is divested of that stimulant which urges on to progress,
and how can progress turn to the public advantage when
it no longer exists? A public functionary does not act under
the spur of self-interest, but under the influence of the law.
The law says to him, “You will render to the public such or
such a determinate service, and you will receive from it in return
a determinate recompense.” A little more or a little less
zeal has no effect in changing these two fixed terms. On the
contrary, private interest whispers in the ear of the free labourer,
“The more you do for others, the more others will do for you.”
In this case, the recompense depends entirely on the efforts of the
workman being more or less intense, and more or less skilful. No
doubt <em class="e000I2">esprit de corps</em>, the desire for advancement, devotion to duty,
may prove active stimulants with the functionary; but they never
can supply the place of the irresistible incitement of personal interest.
All experience confirms this reasoning. Everything which
has fallen within the domain of Government routine has remained
almost stationary. It is doubtful whether our system of education
now is better than it was in the reign of Francis the First; and no
one would think of comparing the activity of a government office
with the activity of a manufactory. <a id="p436" class="xxpn">[p436]</a></p>

<p>In proportion, then, as private services enter into the class of
public services, they become, at least to a certain extent, sterile
and motionless, not to the injury of those who render these
services (their salaries are fixed), but to the detriment of the
public at large.</p>

<p>Along with these inconveniences, which are immense, not only
in a moral and political, but in an economical point of view—inconveniences
which, trusting to the sagacity of the reader, I have
only sketched—there is sometimes an advantage in substituting
collective for individual action. In some kinds of services, the
chief merit is regularity and uniformity. It may happen that,
under certain circumstances, such a substitution gives rise to
economy, and saves, in relation to a given satisfaction, a certain
amount of exertion to the community. The question to be resolved,
then, is this: What services should remain in the domain
of private exertion? What services should pertain to collective or
public exertion? The inquiry, which we have just finished, into
the essential differences which characterize these two kinds of
services, will facilitate the solution of this important problem.</p>

<p>And, first of all, it may be asked, is there any principle to enable
us to distinguish what may legitimately enter the circle of
collective action, and what should remain in the circle of private
action?</p>

<p>I begin by intimating that what I denominate here <em class="e000I2">public action</em>
is that great organization which has for rule the <em class="e000I2">law</em>, and for means
of execution, <em class="e000I2">force</em>; in other words, <em class="e000I2">the Government</em>. Let it not be
said that free and voluntary associations display likewise <em class="e000I2">collective
exertion</em>. Let it not be supposed that I use the term private
action as synonymous with <em class="e000I2">isolated action</em>. What I say is, that
free and voluntary association belongs still to the domain of
private action, for it is one of the forms of exchange, and the
most powerful form of all. It does not impair the equivalence
of services, it does not affect the appreciation of values, it does
not displace responsibilities, it does not exclude free will, it does
not destroy competition nor its effects; in a word, it has not
<em class="e000I2">constraint</em> for its principle.</p>

<p>But the action of Government is made general by <em class="e000I2">constraint</em>.
It necessarily proceeds on the <em class="e000I2">compelle intrare</em>. It acts in form
of <em class="e000I2">law</em>, and every one must submit to it, because a law implies
a <em class="e000I2">sanction</em>. No one, I think, will dispute these premises; which
are supported by the best of all authorities, the testimony of
universal fact. On all sides we have laws, and force to restrain
the refractory. <a id="p437" class="xxpn">[p437]</a></p>

<p>Hence, no doubt, has come the saying that “men, in uniting in
society, have sacrificed part of their liberty in order to preserve
the remainder,”—a saying in great vogue with those who, confounding
<em class="e000I2">government</em> with <em class="e000I2">society</em>, conclude that the latter is
artificial and conventional like the former.</p>

<p>It is evident that this saying does not hold true in the region
of free and voluntary transactions. Let two men, determined by
the prospect of greater profit and advantage, exchange their
services, or unite their efforts, in place of continuing their isolated
exertions—is there in this any sacrifice of liberty? Is it to
sacrifice liberty to make a better use of it?</p>

<p>The most that can be said is this, that men sacrifice part of
their liberty to preserve the remainder, not when they unite in
society, but when they subject themselves to a Government, since
the necessary mode of action of every Government is force.</p>

<p>Now, even with this modification, the pretended principle is
erroneous, as long as Government confines itself to its legitimate
functions.</p>

<p>But what are these functions?</p>

<p>It is precisely this special character of having force for their
necessary auxiliary which marks out to us their extent and their
limits. I affirm that as <em class="e000I2">Government acts only by the intervention
of force, its action is legitimate only where the intervention of
force is itself legitimate</em>.</p>

<p>Now, where force interposes legitimately, it is not to sacrifice
liberty, but to make it more respected. So that this pretended
axiom, which has been represented as the basis of political science,
and which has been shown to be false as far as society is concerned,
is equally false as regards Government. It is always gratifying
to me to see these melancholy theoretical discordances disappear
before a closer and more searching examination.</p>

<p>In what cases is the employment of force legitimate? In one
case, and, I believe, in only one—<em class="e000I2">the case of legitimate defence</em>. If
this be so, the foundation of Government is fully established,
as well as its legitimate limits.<a
href="#FN_99" id="FNa_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p>What is individual right?</p>

<p>The right which an individual possesses to enter freely and
voluntarily into bargains and transactions with his fellow-citizens,
which give rise, as far as they are concerned, to a reciprocal right.
When is this right violated? When one of the parties encroaches
<a id="p438" class="xxpn">[p438]</a> on the liberty of the other. In that case, it is incorrect to say, as
is frequently done, “There is an excess, an abuse of liberty.” We
should say, “There is a want, a destruction of liberty.” An excess
of liberty, no doubt, if we regard only the aggressor, but a destruction
of liberty, if we regard the victim, or even if we regard the
phenomenon as a whole, as we ought to do.</p>

<p>The right of the man whose liberty is attacked, or, which comes
to the same thing, whose property, faculties, or labour is attacked,
is to defend them <em class="e000I2">even by force</em>; and this is in fact what men do
everywhere, and always, when they can.</p>

<p>Hence may be deduced the right of a number of men of any
sort to take counsel together, and associate, in order to defend,
<em class="e000I2">even by their joint force</em>, individual liberty and property.</p>

<p>But an individual has no right to employ force for any other
purpose. I cannot legitimately <em class="e000I2">force</em> my neighbours to be industrious,
sober, economical, generous, learned, devout; but I can
legitimately force them to be just.</p>

<p>For the same reason the collective force cannot be legitimately
applied to develop the love of industry, of sobriety, of economy, of
generosity, of science, of religious belief; but it may be legitimately
applied to ensure the predominance of justice, and vindicate each
man’s right.</p>

<p>For where can we seek for the origin of collective right but in
individual right?</p>

<p>The deplorable mania of our times is the desire to give an independent
existence to pure abstractions, to imagine a city without
citizens, a human nature without human beings, a whole without
parts, an aggregate without the individuals who compose it. They
might as well say, “Here is a man, suppose him without members,
viscera, organs, body, soul, or any of the elements of which he is
composed—still here is a man.”</p>

<p>If a right does not exist in any of the individuals of what
for brevity’s sake we call a nation, how should it exist in the
nation itself? How, above all, should it exist in that fraction
of a nation which exercises delegated rights of government?
How could individuals delegate rights which they do not themselves
possess?</p>

<p>We must, then, regard as a fundamental principle in politics,
this incontestable truth, that between individuals the intervention
of force is legitimate only in the case of legitimate defence; and
that a collective body of men cannot have recourse to force legally,
but within the same limit.</p>

<p>Now, it is of the very essence of Government to act upon <a id="p439" class="xxpn">[p439]</a> individuals
by way of constraint. Then it can have no other rational
functions than the legitimate defence of individual rights, it can
have no delegated authority except to secure respect to the lives
and property of all.</p>

<p>Observe that when a Government goes beyond these bounds, it
enters on an illimited career, and cannot escape this consequence,
not only that it goes beyond its mission, but annihilates it, which
constitutes the most monstrous of contradictions.</p>

<p>In truth, when the State has caused to be respected this
fixed and invariable line which separates the rights of the
citizens, when it has maintained among them justice, what could
it do more without itself breaking through that barrier, the
guardianship of which has been intrusted to it—in other words,
without destroying with its own hands, and by force, that very
liberty and property which had been placed under its safeguard?
Beyond the administration and enforcement of justice, I defy you
to imagine an intervention of Government which is not an injustice.
Allege, as long as you choose, acts inspired by the
purest philanthropy, encouragements held out to virtue and to
industry, premiums, favour, and direct protection, gifts said to be
gratuitous, initiatives styled generous; behind all these fair appearances,
or, if you will, these fair realities, I will show you other
realities less gratifying; the rights of some persons violated for
the benefit of others, liberties sacrificed, rights of property usurped,
faculties limited, spoliations consummated. And can the people
possibly behold a spectacle more melancholy, more painful, than
that of the collective force employed in perpetrating crimes which
it is its special duty to repress?</p>

<p>In principle, it is enough that the Government has at its disposal,
as a necessary instrument, <em class="e000I2">force</em>, in order to enable us to
discover what the private services are which can legitimately
be converted into <em class="e000I2">public services</em>. They are those which have
for their object the maintenance of liberty, property, and individual
right, the prevention of crime—in a word, everything
which involves the <em class="e000I2">public security</em>.</p>

<p>Governments have yet another mission.</p>

<p>There are in all countries a certain amount of common property,
enjoyed by the citizens jointly—rivers, forests, roads. On the
other hand, unfortunately, there are also debts. It is the duty of
Government to administer this active and passive portion of the
public domain.</p>

<p>In fine, from these two functions there flows another,—that of
levying the contributions which are necessary for the <em class="e000I2">public service</em>. <a id="p440" class="xxpn">[p440]</a></p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<p>To watch over the public security.</p>

<p>To administer common property.</p>

<p>To levy taxes.</p>

<p>Such I believe to be the legitimate circle within which Government
functions ought to be circumscribed, and to which they
should be brought back if they have gone beyond it.</p>

<p>This opinion, I know, runs counter to received opinions.
“What!” it will be said, “you wish to reduce Government to
play the part of a judge and a police-officer! You would take
away from it all initiative! You would restrain it from giving
a lively impulse to learning, to arts, to commerce, to navigation,
to agriculture, to moral and religious ideas; you would despoil
it of its fairest attribute, that of opening to the people the road of
progress!”</p>

<p>To people who talk in this way, I should like to put a few
questions.</p>

<p>Where has God placed the motive spring of human conduct,
and the aspiration after progress? Is it in all men? or is it
exclusively in those among them who have received, or usurped,
the delegated authority of a legislator, or the patent of a placeman?
Does every one of us not carry in his organization, in his
whole being, that boundless, restless principle of action called
<em class="e000I2">desire</em>? When our first and most urgent wants are supplied, are
there not formed within us concentric and expansive circles of
desires of an order more and more elevated? Does the love
of arts, of letters, of science, of moral and religious truth, does
a thirst for the solution of those problems which concern our
present and future existence, descend from collective bodies of
men to individuals, from abstractions to realities, from mere
words to living and sentient beings?</p>

<p>If you set out with this assumption—absurd upon the face of
it—that moral energy resides in the State, and that the nation
is passive, do you not place morals, doctrines, opinions, wealth, all
which constitutes individual life, at the mercy of men in power?</p>

<p>Then, in order to enable it to discharge the formidable duty
which you would intrust to it, has the State any resources of its
own? Is it not obliged to take everything of which it disposes,
down to the last penny, from the citizens themselves? If it be
from individuals that it demands the means of execution, individuals
have realized these means. It is a contradiction, then, to
pretend that individuality is passive and inert. And why have
individuals created these resources? To minister to their own
<a id="p441" class="xxpn">[p441]</a> satisfactions. What does the State do when it seizes on these
resources? It does not bring satisfactions into existence, it <em class="e000I2">displaces</em>
them. It deprives the man who earned them in order to
endow a man who has no right to them. Charged to chastise
injustice, it perpetrates it.</p>

<p>Will it be said that in displacing satisfactions it purifies them,
and renders them more moral?—that the wealth which individuals
had devoted to gross and sensual wants the State has devoted to
moral purposes? Who dare affirm that it is advantageous to
invert violently, <em class="e000I2">by force</em>, by means of spoliation, the natural
order according to which the wants and desires of men are
developed?—that it is moral to take a morsel of bread from
the hungry peasant, in order to bring within the reach of the
inhabitants of our large towns the doubtful morality of theatrical
entertainments?</p>

<p>And then it must be remembered, that you cannot displace
wealth without displacing labour and population. Any arrangement
you can make must be artificial and precarious when it is
thus substituted for a solid and regular order of things reposing
on the immutable laws of nature.</p>

<p>There are people who believe that by circumscribing the province
of Government you enfeeble it. Numerous functions and
numerous agents, they think, give the State the solidity of a
broader basis. But this is pure illusion. If the State cannot
overstep the limits of its proper and determinate functions without
becoming an instrument of injustice, of ruin, and of spoliation—without
unsettling the natural distribution of labour, of enjoyments,
of capital, and of population—without creating commercial stoppages,
industrial crises, and pauperism—without enlarging the
proportion of crimes and offences—without recurring to more and
more energetic means of repression—without exciting discontent
and disaffection,—how is it possible to discover a guarantee for
stability in these accumulated elements of disorder?</p>

<p>You complain of the revolutionary tendencies of men, but without
sufficient reflection. When in a great country we see private
services invaded and converted into public services, the Government
laying hold of one-third of the wealth produced by the
citizens, the law converted into an engine of spoliation by the
citizens themselves, thus impairing, under pretence of establishing,
the equivalence of services—when we see population and labour
displaced by legislation, a deeper and deeper gulf interposed
between wealth and poverty, capital, which should give employment
to an increasing population, prevented from accumulating,
<a id="p442" class="xxpn">[p442]</a> entire classes ground down by the hardest privations—when we see
Governments taking to themselves credit for any prosperity which
may be observable, proclaiming themselves the movers and originators
of everything, and thus accepting responsibility for all the
evils which afflict society,—we are only astonished that revolutions
do not occur more frequently, and we admire the sacrifices which
are made by the people to the cause of public order and tranquillity.</p>

<p>But if laws and the Governments which enact laws confined
themselves within the limits I have indicated, how could revolutions
occur? If each citizen were free, he would doubtless be
less exposed to suffering; and if, at the same time, the feeling
of responsibility were brought to bear on him from all sides, how
should he ever take it into his head to attribute his sufferings to a
law, to a Government which concerned itself no farther with him
than to repress his acts of injustice and protect him from the injustice
of others? Do we ever find a village rising against the
authority of the local magistrate?</p>

<p>The influence of liberty on the cause of order is sensibly felt in
the United States. There, all, save the administration of justice
and of public property, is left to the free and voluntary transactions
of the citizens; and there, accordingly, we find fewer of the elements
and chances of revolution than in any other country of the
world. What semblance of interest, could the citizens of such a
country have in changing the established order of things by violence,
when, on the one hand, this order of things clashes with no
man’s interests, and, on the other, may be legally and readily
modified if necessary?</p>

<p>But I am wrong. There are two active causes of revolution at
work in the United States—slavery and commercial restriction.
It is notorious that these two questions are constantly placing in
jeopardy the public peace and the federal union. Now, is it
possible to conceive a more decisive argument in support of the
thesis I am now maintaining? Have we not here an instance of
the law acting in direct antagonism to what ought to be the design
and aim of all laws? Is not this a case of law and public force
sanctioning, strengthening, perpetuating, systematizing, and protecting
oppression and spoliation, in place of fulfilling its legitimate
mission of protecting liberty and property? As regards slavery,
the law says, “I shall create a force, at the expense of the citizens,
not to maintain each in his rights, but to annihilate altogether the
rights of a portion of the inhabitants.” As regards tariffs, the law
says, “I shall create a force, at the expense of the citizens, not to
ensure the freedom of their bargains and transactions, but to
<a id="p443" class="xxpn">[p443]</a> destroy that freedom, to impair the equivalence of services, to give
to one citizen the liberty of two, and to deprive another of liberty
altogether. My function is to commit injustice, which I nevertheless
visit with the severest punishment when committed by the
citizens themselves without my interposition.”</p>

<p>It is not, then, because we have few laws and few functionaries,
or, in other words, because we have few public services, that
revolutions are to be feared; but, on the contrary, because we
have many laws, many functionaries, and many public services.
Public services, the law which regulates them, the force which
establishes them, are from their nature never neutral. They may
be enlarged without danger, on the contrary with advantage, when
they are necessary to the vigorous enforcement of justice; but
carried beyond this point they are so many instruments of legal
oppression and spoliation, so many causes of disorder and revolutionary
ferment.</p>

<p>Shall I venture to describe the poisonous immorality which is
infused into all the veins of the body politic, when the law thus
sets itself, upon principle, to indulge the plundering propensities
of the citizens? Attend a meeting of the national representatives
when the question happens to turn on bounties, encouragements,
favours, or restrictions. See with what shameless rapacity all
endeavour to secure a share of the spoil,—spoil which, as individuals,
they would blush to touch. The very man who would
regard himself as a highway robber, if, meeting me on the frontier
and clapping a pistol to my head, he prevented me from concluding
a bargain which was for my advantage, makes no scruple whatever
in proposing and voting a law which substitutes the public force
for his own, and subjects me to the very same restriction at my
own expense. In this respect, what a melancholy spectacle France
presents at this very moment! All classes are suffering, and in
place of demanding the abolition for ever of all legal spoliation,
each turns to the law, and says, “You who can do everything, you
who have the public force at your disposal, you who can bring
good out of evil, be pleased to rob and plunder all other classes, to
put money in my pocket. Force them to come to my shop, or
pay me bounties and premiums, give my family gratuitous education,
lend me money without interest,” etc.</p>

<p>It is in this way that the law becomes a source of demoralization,
and if anything ought to surprise us, it is that the propensity
to individual plunder does not make more progress, when the moral
sense of the nation is thus perverted by legislation itself.</p>

<p>The deplorable thing is, that spoliation, when thus sanctioned by
<a id="p444" class="xxpn">[p444]</a> law, and opposed by no individual scruple, ends by becoming quite
a learned theory with an attendant train of professors, journals,
doctors, legislators, sophisms, and subtleties. Among the traditional
quibbles which are brought forward in its support we may
remark this one, namely, that, <em class="e000I2">cæteris paribus</em>, an enlargement of
<em class="e000I2">demand</em> is of advantage to those by whom labour is supplied, seeing
that the new relation between a more active demand and a supply
which is stationary is what increases the <em class="e000I2">value</em> of the service.
From these premises the conclusion follows that spoliation is of
advantage to everybody: to the plundering class, which it enriches
directly; to the plundered class, by its reflex influence. The
plundering class having become richer finds itself in a situation to
enlarge the circle of its enjoyments, and this it cannot do without
creating a larger <em class="e000I2">demand</em> for the <em class="e000I2">services</em> of the class which has
been robbed. Now, as regards each service, an enlargement of
demand is an increase of value. The classes, then, who are
legally plundered are too happy to be robbed, since the profit
arising from the theft thus redounds to them, and helps to find
them employment.</p>

<p>As long as the law confined itself to robbing the many for the
benefit of the few, this quibble appeared specious, and was never
invoked but with success. “Let us hand over to the rich,” it was
said, “the taxes levied from the poor, and we shall thus augment
the capital of the wealthy classes. The rich will indulge in luxury,
and luxury will give employment to the poor.” And all, poor
included, regarded this recipe as infallible; and for having exposed
its hollowness, I have been long regarded, and am still regarded,
as an enemy of the working classes.</p>

<p>But since the revolution of February the poor have had a voice
in the making of our laws. Have they required that the law should
cease to sanction spoliation? Not at all. The sophism of the
rebound, of the reflex influence, has got too firmly into their heads.
What is it they have asked for? That the law should become
impartial, and consent to rob all classes in their turn. They have
asked for gratis education, gratis advances of capital, friendly
societies founded by the State, progressive taxation, etc. And
then the rich have set themselves to cry out, “How scandalous!
All is over with us! New barbarians threaten society with an
irruption!” To the pretensions of the poor they have opposed
a desperate resistance, first with the bayonet and then with the
ballot-box. But for all this, have the rich given up spoliation?
They have not even dreamt of that; and the argument of the
rebound still serves as the pretext. <a id="p445" class="xxpn">[p445]</a></p>

<p>Were this system of spoliation carried on by them directly, and
without the intervention of the law, the sophism would become
transparent. Were you to take from the pocket of the workman a
franc to pay your ticket to the theatre, would you have the face
to say to him, “My good friend, this franc will circulate and give
employment to you and others of your class?” Or if you did,
would he not be justified in answering, “The franc will circulate
just as well if you do not steal it from me. It will go to the baker
instead of the scene-painter. It will procure me bread in place
of procuring you amusement.”</p>

<p>We may remark, also, that the sophism of the rebound may be
invoked by the poor in their turn. They may say in their turn
to the rich, “Let the law assist us in robbing you. We shall
consume more cloth, and that will benefit your manufactures;
more meat, and that will benefit your land estates; more sugar,
and that will benefit your shipping.”</p>

<p>Unhappy, thrice unhappy, nation in which such questions are
raised, in which no one thinks of making the law the rule of equity,
but an instrument of plunder to fill his own pockets, and applies
the whole power of his intellect to try to find excuses among the
more remote and complicated effects of spoliation. In support of
these reflections it may not be out of place to add here an extract
from the debate which took place at a meeting of the <em class="e000I2">Conseil
général des Manufactures, de l’Agriculture, et du Commerce</em>, on
Saturday the 27th April 1850.<a

DISTURBING CAUSES.</h2>

<p class="chapterhead">
In what state would human society have been, had the transactions
of mankind never been in any shape infected with force or fraud,
oppression or deceit?</p>

<p>Would Justice and Liberty have given rise inevitably to
Inequality and Monopoly?</p>

<p>To find an answer to these questions it would seem to me to be
necessary to study the nature of human transactions in their
essence, in their origin, in their consequences, and in the consequences
of these consequences, down to the final result; and
this apart from the consideration of contingent disturbances
which might engender injustice; for it will be readily granted
that injustice is not of the essence of free and voluntary transactions.</p>

<p>That the entry of Injustice into the world was inevitable, and
that society cannot get rid of it, may be argued plausibly, and I
think even conclusively, if we take man as he exists, with his passions,
his egotism, his ignorance, and his original improvidence.
We must also, therefore, direct our attention to the origin and
effects of Injustice.</p>

<p>But it is not the less true that economical science must set out
by explaining the theory of human transactions, assuming them to
be free and voluntary, just as physiology explains the nature and
relations of our organs, apart from the consideration of the disturbing
causes which modify these relations.</p>

<p>Services, as we have seen, are exchanged for services, and the
great <em class="e000I2">desideratum</em> is the equivalence of the services thus exchanged.</p>

<p>The best chance, it would seem, of arriving at this equivalence,
is that it should be produced under the influence of Liberty, and
that every man should be allowed to judge for himself. <a id="p447" class="xxpn">[p447]</a></p>

<p>We know that men may be mistaken; but we know also that
they have the power given them of rectifying their mistakes; and
the longer, as it appears to us, that error is persisted in, the nearer
we approximate to its rectification.</p>

<p>Everything which restrains liberty would seem to disturb the
equivalence of services, and everything which disturbs the equivalence
of services engenders inequality in an exaggerated degree,
endowing some with unmerited opulence, entailing on others
poverty equally unmerited, together with the destruction of
national wealth, and an attendant train of evils, heartburnings,
disturbances, convulsions, and revolutions.</p>

<p>We shall not go the length of saying that Liberty—or the
equivalence of services—produces absolute equality; for we believe
in nothing absolute in what concerns man. But we think that
Liberty tends to make men approximate towards a common level,
which is movable and always rising.</p>

<p>We think also that the inequality which may still remain under
a free <em class="e000I2">régime</em> is either the result of accidental circumstances, or the
chastisement of faults and vices, or the compensation of other advantages
set opposite to those of wealth; and, consequently, that
this inequality ought not to introduce among men any feeling of
irritation.</p>

<p>In a word, we believe that <em class="e000I2">Liberty is Harmony</em>.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>But in order to discover whether this harmony exists in reality,
or only in our own imagination, whether it be in us a perception
or only an aspiration, we must subject free transactions to the test
of scientific inquiry; we must study facts, with their relations and
consequences.</p>

<p>This is what we have endeavoured to do.</p>

<p>We have seen that although countless obstacles are interposed
between the wants of man and his satisfactions, so that
in a state of isolation he could not exist—yet by the union
of forces, the separation of occupations, in a word, by exchange,
his faculties are developed to such an extent as to enable him
gradually to overcome the first obstacles, to encounter the second
and overcome them also, and so on in a progression as much more
rapid as exchange is rendered more easy by the increasing density
of population.</p>

<p>We have seen that his intelligence places at his disposal means
of action more and more numerous, energetic, and perfect, that in
proportion as capital increases, his absolute share in the produce
increases, and his relative share diminishes, while both the
absolute and relative share falling to the labourer goes on <a id="p448" class="xxpn">[p448]</a> constantly
increasing. This is the primary and most powerful cause
of equality.</p>

<p>We have seen that that admirable instrument of production
called land, that marvellous laboratory in which are prepared all
things necessary for the food, clothing, and shelter of man, has
been given him gratuitously by the Creator; that although the
land is nominally appropriated, its productive action cannot be so,
but remains gratuitous throughout the whole range of human
transactions.</p>

<p>We have seen that Property has not only this negative effect of
not encroaching on community; but that it works directly and
constantly in enlarging its domain; and this is a second cause of
equality, seeing that the more abundant the common fund becomes,
the more is the inequality of property effaced.</p>

<p>We have seen that under the influence of liberty services tend
to acquire their normal value, that is to say, a value proportionate
to the labour. This is a third cause of equality.</p>

<p>For these reasons we conclude that there is a tendency to the
establishment among men of a natural level, not by bringing them
back to a retrograde position, or allowing them to remain stationary,
but urging them on to a state which is constantly progressive.</p>

<p>In fine, we have seen that it is not the tendency of the laws of
Value, of Interest, of Rent, of Population, or any other great
natural law, to introduce dissonance into the beautiful order of
society, as crude science has endeavoured to persuade us, but, on
the contrary, that all these laws lead to harmony.</p>

<p>Having reached this point, I think I hear the reader cry out,
“The Economists are optimists with a vengeance! It is in vain
that suffering, poverty, inadequate wages, pauperism, the desertion
of children, starvation, crime, rebellion, inequality, are before
their eyes; they chant complacently the harmony of the social
laws, and turn away from a hideous spectacle which mars their
enjoyment of the theory in which they are wrapt up. They shun
the region of realities, in order to take refuge, like the Utopian
dreamers whom they blame, in a region of chimeras. More illogical
than the Socialists or the Communists themselves—who confess
the existence of suffering, feel it, describe it, abhor it, and only
commit the error of prescribing ineffectual, impracticable, and
empirical remedies—the Economists either deny the existence of
suffering, or are insensible to it, if, indeed, they do not engender
it, calling out to diseased and distempered society, ‘<em class="e000I2">Laissez
faire, laissez passer</em>; all is for the best in this best of all possible
worlds.’” <a id="p449" class="xxpn">[p449]</a></p>

<p>In the name of science, I repel, I repudiate with all my might,
such reproaches and such interpretations of our words. We see
the existence of suffering as clearly as our opponents. Like them,
we deplore it, like them we endeavour to discover its causes, like
them we are ready to combat them. But we state the question
differently. “Society,” say they, “such as liberty of labour and
commercial transactions (that is to say, the free play of natural
laws) has made it, is detestable. Break, then, the wheels of this
ill-going machine, liberty (which they take care to nickname
competition, or oftener anarchical competition), and substitute for
them, by force, new wheels of our invention.” No sooner said
than done. Millions of inventions are paraded; and this we
might naturally expect, for to imaginary space there are no
limits.</p>

<p>As for us, after having studied the natural and providential
laws of society, we affirm that these laws are harmonious. These
laws admit the existence of evil, for they are brought into play by
men,—by beings subject to error and to suffering. But in this
mechanism evil has itself a function to perform, which is to
circumscribe more and more its own limits, and ultimately to
check its own action, by preparing for man warnings, corrections,
experience, knowledge; all things which are comprehended and
summed up in the word, Improvement.</p>

<p>We add that it is not true that liberty prevails among men, nor
is it true that the providential laws exert all their action. If they
do act, at least, it is to repair slowly and painfully the disturbing
action of ignorance and error. Don’t arraign us, then, for using
the words <em class="e000I2">laissez faire</em>, <em class="e000I2">let alone</em>;
for we do not mean by that, let
man alone when he is doing wrong. What we mean is this:
Study the providential laws, admire them, and <em class="e000I2">allow them to
operate</em>. Remove the obstacles which they encounter from abuses
arising from force and fraud, and you will see accomplished in
human society this double manifestation of progress—equalization
in amelioration.</p>

<p>For, in short, of two things one: either the interests of men are,
in their own nature, concordant, or they are in their nature discordant.
When we talk of one’s Interest, we talk of a thing
towards which a man gravitates necessarily, unavoidably; otherwise
it would cease to be called interest. If men gravitated
towards something else, that other thing would be termed their
interest. If men’s interests, then, are concordant, all that is
necessary in order to the realization of harmony and happiness
is that these interests should be understood, since men naturally
<a id="p450" class="xxpn">[p450]</a> pursue their interest. This is all we contend for; and this is
the reason why we say, <em class="e000I2">Eclairez et laissez faire</em>, Enlighten men,
and let them alone. If men’s interests are in their nature and
essence discordant, then you are right, and there is no other
way of producing harmony, but by forcing, thwarting, and running
counter to these interests. A whimsical harmony, truly, which
can result only from an external and despotic action directed
against the interests of all! For you can easily understand that
men will not tamely allow themselves to be thwarted; and in
order to obtain their acquiescence in your inventions, you must
either begin by being stronger than the whole human family, or
else you must be able to succeed in deceiving them with reference
to their true interests. In short, on the hypothesis that men’s
interests are naturally discordant, the best thing which could
happen would be their being all deceived in this respect.</p>

<p>Force and imposture, these are your sole resources. I defy you
to find another, unless you admit that men’s interests are harmonious,—and
if you grant that, you are with us, and will say,
as we say, Allow the providential laws to act.</p>

<p>Now, this you will not do; and therefore. I must repeat that
your starting-point is the antagonism of interests. This is the
reason why you will not allow these interests to come to a
mutual arrangement and understanding freely and voluntarily;
this is the reason why you advocate arbitrary measures, and repudiate
liberty; and you are consistent.</p>

<p>But take care. The struggle which is approaching will not be
exclusively between you and society. Such a struggle you lay
your account with, the thwarting of men’s interests being the
very object you have in view. The battle will also rage among
you, the inventors and organizers of artificial societies, yourselves;
for there are thousands of you, and there will soon be tens of
thousands, all entertaining and advocating different views. What
will you do? I see very clearly what you will do,—you will
endeavour to get possession of the Government. That is the
only force capable of overcoming all resistance. Will some one
among you succeed? While he is engaged in thwarting and
opposing the Government, he will find himself set upon by all
the other inventors, equally desirous to seize upon the Government;
and their chances of success will be so much the greater,
seeing that they will be aided by that public disaffection which
has been stirred up by the previous opposition to their interests.
Here, then, we are launched into a stormy sea of eternal revolutions,
and with no other object than the solution of this question:
<a id="p451" class="xxpn">[p451]</a> How, and by whom, can the interests of mankind be most effectually
thwarted?</p>

<p>Let me not be accused of exaggeration. All this is forced upon
us if men’s interests are naturally discordant, for on this hypothesis
you never can get out of the dilemma, that either these interests
will be left to themselves, and then disorder will follow, or some
one must be strong enough to run counter to them, and in that
case we shall still have disorder.</p>

<p>It is true that there is a third course, as I have already indicated.
It consists in deceiving men with reference to their
true interests; and this course being above the power of a mere
mortal, the shortest way is for the <em class="e000I2">organisateur</em> to erect himself
into an oracle. This is a part which these Utopian dreamers, when
they dare, never fail to play, until they become Ministers of State.
They fill their writings with mystical cant; and it is with these
paper kites that they find out how the wind sits, and make their
first experiments on public credulity. But, unfortunately for
them, success in such experiments is not very easily achieved in
the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>We confess, then, frankly that, in order to get rid of these inextricable
difficulties, it is much to be desired that, having studied
human interests, we should find them harmonious. The duty of
writers and that of governments become in that case rational and
easy.</p>

<p>As mankind frequently mistake their true interests, our duty as
writers ought to be to explain these interests, to describe them, to
make them understood, for we may be quite certain that if men
once see their interest, they will follow it. As a man who is mistaken
with reference to his own interests injures those of the
public (this results from their harmony), the duty of Government
will be to bring back the small body of dissentients and violators
of the providential laws into the path of justice, which is identical
with that of utility. In other words, the single mission of Government
will be to establish the dominion of justice; and it will no
longer have to embarrass itself with the painful endeavour to produce,
at great cost, and by encroaching on individual liberty, a
Harmony which is self-created, and which Government action
never fails to destroy.</p>

<p>After what has been said, we shall not be regarded as such
fanatical advocates of social harmony as to deny that it may be,
and frequently is, disturbed. I will even add that, in my opinion,
the disturbances of the social order, which are caused by blind
passions, ignorance, and error, are infinitely greater and more
pro <a id="p452" class="xxpn">[p452]</a> longed than are generally supposed; and it is these disturbing
causes which we are about to make the subject of our inquiry.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Man comes into the world having implanted in him ineradicably
the desire of happiness and aversion from pain. Seeing that he
acts in obedience to this impulse, we cannot deny that personal
interest is the moving spring of the individual, of all individuals,
and, consequently, of society. And seeing that personal interest,
in the economic sphere, is the motive of human actions
and the mainspring of society, Evil must proceed from it as
well as Good; and it is in this motive power that we must seek
to discover harmony and the causes by which that harmony is
disturbed.</p>

<p>The constant aspiration of self-interest is to silence want, or, to
speak more generally, desire, by satisfaction.</p>

<p>Between these two terms, which are essentially personal and
intransmissible, want and satisfaction, there is interposed a mean
term which is transmissible and exchangeable,—effort.</p>

<p>Over all this mechanism we have placed the faculty of comparing,
of judging—mind, intelligence. But human intelligence
is fallible. We may be mistaken. That is beyond dispute;
for were any one to assert that man cannot err, we should at once
conclude that it was unnecessary to hold any farther argument
with him.</p>

<p>We may be mistaken in many ways. We may, for instance,
form a wrong appreciation of the relative importance of our wants.
In this case, were we living in a state of isolation, we should give
to our efforts a direction not in accordance with our true interests.
In a state of society, and under the operation of the law of exchange,
the effect would be the same; for then we should direct
demand and remuneration to services of a kind either frivolous or
hurtful, and so give a wrong direction to labour.</p>

<p>We may also err, from being ignorant that a satisfaction which
we ardently seek for can only remove a suffering by becoming the
source of still greater sufferings. There is scarcely any effect
which may not in its turn become a cause. Foresight has been
given us to enable us to observe the concatenation of effects,
so that we may not sacrifice the future to the present; but we are
frequently deficient in foresight.</p>

<p>Here, then, is the first source of evil, error arising from the
feebleness of our judgment or the force of our passions; and it
belongs principally to the domain of morals. In this case, as the
error and the passion are individual, the resulting evil must, to a
<a id="p453" class="xxpn">[p453]</a> certain extent, be individual also; and reflection, experience, and
the feeling of responsibility are its proper correctives.</p>

<p>Errors of this class, however, may assume a social character, and,
when erected into a system, may give rise to widespread suffering.
There are countries, for example, in which the governing power is
strongly convinced that the prosperity of nations is measured, not
by the amount of wants which are satisfied, but by the amount
of efforts, whatever may be their results. The division of labour
assists powerfully this illusion. When we observe that each profession
sets itself to overcome a certain species of obstacle, we
imagine that the existence of that obstacle is the source of wealth.
In such countries, when vanity, frivolity, or a false love of glory are
predominant passions, and provoke corresponding desires, and
determine a portion of the national industry in that direction,
Governments believe that all will be over with them if their subjects
come to be reformed and rendered more moral. What will
become now, they say, of milliners, cooks, grooms, embroiderers,
dancers, lace-manufactures, etc.? They do not reflect that the
human heart is always large enough to contain enough of honest,
reasonable, and legitimate desires to afford employment and support
to labour; that the business is not to suppress desires, but to
rectify and purify them; and that labour, consequently, following
the same evolution, may have its direction changed and still
be carried on to the same extent as before. In countries where
these melancholy doctrines prevail, we hear it frequently said,
“It is unfortunate that morals and industry cannot march side
by side. We should desire, indeed, that the citizens should be
moral, but we cannot allow them to become idle and poor. This
is the reason why we must continue to make laws which are
favourable to luxury. If necessary, we impose taxes on the
people; and for the sake of the people, and to ensure them employment,
we charge Kings, Presidents, Ambassadors, Ministers,
with the duty of <em class="e000I2">representing</em> them.” All this is said and done
in the best possible faith; and the people themselves acquiesce
in it with a good grace. It is very clear that when luxury and
frivolity thus become a legislative affair, regulated, decreed, imposed,
systematized, by public force, the law of Responsibility
loses all its moral power.<a href="#FN_101" id="FNa_101"

<p class="chapterhead">
Of all the circumstances which contribute to impart to nations
their distinctive character and aspect, and to form and modify their
genius, their moral condition, their customs, and their laws, the one
which exerts a far more powerful influence than all the rest, because
it includes all the rest, is the manner in which they provide
for their subsistence. For this observation we are indebted to Charles
Comte, and we have reason to be surprised that it has not had a more
prominent place given to it in the moral and political sciences.</p>

<p>This circumstance, in fact, acts upon the human race in two
ways, and with equal power in both,—by its continuity, and by its
universality. To subsist, to better one’s condition, to bring up a
family, are not affairs of time, or place, or taste, or opinion, or
choice; they are the daily, constant, and unavoidable concern of all
men, at all times, and in all countries.</p>

<p>Everywhere, the greater part of their moral, intellectual, and physical
force is devoted directly or indirectly to create and replace
the means of subsistence. The hunter, the fisher, the shepherd, the
agriculturist, the manufacturer, the merchant, the labourer, the
artisan, the capitalist,—all think first of all how they are to live
(prosaic as the avowal may seem), and then how to live better and
better, if they can. The proof of it is that it is only for this end
that they are hunters, fishers, manufacturers, agriculturists, etc. In
the same way, the public functionary, the soldier, the magistrate,
enter upon their careers in order to ensure the supply of their
wants. We do not necessarily charge a man with want of devotion
or disinterestedness when we quote the proverb, <em class="e000I2">The priest lives
by the altar</em>, for before he belonged to the priesthood he belonged
to humanity; and if at this moment he sits down to write a book
against this vulgar view of human nature, the sale of his book will
demolish his argument. <a id="p455" class="xxpn">[p455]</a></p>

<p>God forbid that I should seek to deny the existence of self-denial
and disinterestedness. But it must be granted that they
are exceptional, and it is because they are so that they merit and
call forth our admiration. If we consider human nature in its
entirety, without having made a previous covenant with the
demon of sentimentalism, we must allow that disinterested efforts
bear no comparison, as respects their number, with those which
are called forth by the hard necessities of our condition. And
it is because those efforts, which constitute the aggregate of
our employments, engross so large a portion of each man’s life,
that they cannot fail to exert a powerful influence on national
character.</p>

<p>M. Saint-Marc Girardin says somewhere or other that he has
been led to acknowledge the relative insignificance of political
forms in comparison with those great general laws which their
employments and their wants impose upon nations. “Do you
desire to know the condition of a people?” says he, “ask not
how they are governed, but how they are employed.”</p>

<p>As a general view, this is just; but the author hastens to falsify
it by converting it into a system. The importance of political
forms has been exaggerated; and what does he do? He denies
their importance altogether, or acknowledges it only to laugh at
it. Forms of government, he says, do not interest us but on the
day of an election, or when we are reading the newspapers.
Monarchy or Republic, Aristocracy or Democracy, what matters
it? And what conclusion does he arrive at? In maintaining
that <em class="e000I2">infant</em> nations resemble each other, whatever their political
constitution happens to be, he assimilates the United States to
ancient Egypt, because in both countries gigantic works have
been executed. Americans clear lands, dig canals, construct railways,
and they do all this for themselves, because they are a
democracy, and their own masters. The Egyptians raised temples,
pyramids, obelisks, and palaces for their kings and their priests,
because they were slaves. And yet we are told that the difference
is a mere affair of form, not worth regarding, or which we should
regard merely to laugh at. Alas! how the contagion of classical
lore corrupts and misleads its superstitious votaries!</p>

<p>M. Saint-Marc Girardin, still proceeding on his general proposition
that the prevailing occupations of a nation determine its
genius, soon after remarks that formerly we were occupied with
war and religion, but nowadays with commerce and manufactures.
This is the reason why former generations bore a warlike and
religious impress. <a id="p456" class="xxpn">[p456]</a></p>

<p>Rousseau had long before remarked that the care for subsistence
was the prevailing occupation only of some nations, and those the
most prosaic; and that other nations, more worthy of the name,
had devoted themselves to nobler exertions.</p>

<p>Now, in this have not both M. Saint-Marc Girardin and
Rousseau been the dupes of an historical illusion? Have they
not mistaken the amusements, the diversions, or the pretexts and
instruments of despotism, which give employment to some of the
people, for the occupations of all? And has the illusion not arisen
from this, that historians are always telling us about the class
which does not work, never about the class which does; and in
this way we come to regard the first of these classes as the entire
nation.</p>

<p>I cannot help thinking that among the Greeks, among the
Romans, among the people of the Middle Ages, men just did
what they do now, and were subject to wants so pressing
and so constantly recurring, that they were obliged to provide
for them under pain of death. Hence I cannot help concluding
that such employments then, as at present, formed the
principal and absorbing occupation of the great bulk of the human
race.</p>

<p>This much is certain, that very few people succeeded in living
without work, on the labour of the subject masses. The small
number of idlers who did so caused their slaves to construct for
them sumptuous palaces, magnificent castles, and sombre fortresses.
They loved to surround themselves with all the sensual enjoyments
of life, and with all the monuments of art. They amused themselves
by descanting on philosophy and cosmogony; and, above
all, they cultivated assiduously the two sciences to which they
owed their supremacy and their enjoyments,—the science of force,
and the science of fraud.</p>

<p>Although below this aristocracy there existed countless multitudes
engaged in creating for themselves the means of sustaining
life, and for their oppressors the means of revelling in pleasures,
yet as historians have never made the slightest allusion to those
multitudes, we have come to forget their existence, and never
taken them into account. Our regards are exclusively fixed on
the aristocracy. To it we give the name of <em class="e000I2">Old or Feudal
Families</em>; and we imagine that the men of those times maintained
themselves without having recourse to commerce, to
manufactures, to labour, to vulgar occupations. We admire
their disinterestedness, their generosity, their taste for the arts,
their spirituality, their disdain of servile employments, their <a id="p457" class="xxpn">[p457]</a>
elevation of mind and sentiment, and, in high-sounding language,
we assert that at one epoch nations cared only for military
glory, at another for the arts, at another for philosophy,
at another for religion, at another for virtue. We sincerely
lament our own condition, and give utterance to all sorts of
sarcastic observations, to the effect that, in spite of these sublime
models, we are unable to attain the same elevation, but are reduced
to assign to labour and its vulgar merits a prominent place
in the system of modern life.</p>

<p>Let us console ourselves with the reflection that it occupied a
no less important place among the ancients. Only, the drudgery
of labour, from which a limited number of people had succeeded in
freeing themselves, fell with redoubled weight upon the enslaved
masses, to the great detriment of justice, of liberty, of property, of
wealth, of equality, and of progress. This is the first of those
disturbing causes to which I propose to solicit the attention of the
reader.</p>

<p>The means, then, to which men have recourse in order to obtain
the means of subsistence cannot fail to exert a powerful influence
on their condition, physical, moral, intellectual, economical, and
political. Who can doubt that if we were in a situation to observe
different tribes of men, one of which had devoted itself exclusively
to the chase, another to fishing, a third to agriculture, a fourth to
navigation, we should discover very considerable differences in
their ideas, in their opinions, in their habits, their manners, their
customs, their laws, and their religion? No doubt we should find
human nature everywhere essentially the same; these various
laws, customs, and religions would have many points in common;
and such points we designate as the general laws of human
society.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, there can be no doubt that in our great
modern societies we find at work all, or nearly all, the various
means of providing subsistence,—fisheries, agriculture, manufactures,
commerce, arts, and sciences, although in different proportions
in different countries. This is the reason why we do not
discover among nations so situated such marked and striking
differences as would be apparent if each devoted itself to one of
these occupations exclusively.</p>

<p>But if the nature of the occupations in which a people is engaged
exercises a powerful influence on its morality, its desires, and its
tastes,—its morality in its turn exercises a great influence upon its
occupations, at least upon the proportion which obtains between
these occupations. But I shall not dwell on this observation,
<a id="p458" class="xxpn">[p458]</a> which I have presented in another part of this work,<a
href="#FN_102" id="FNa_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> but hasten
to the principal subject of the present chapter.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>A man (and the same thing may be said of a people) may procure
the means of existence in two ways,—by creating them, or by
stealing them.</p>

<p>Each of these two great sources of acquisition presents a variety
of methods.</p>

<p>We may <em class="e000I2">create</em> the means of existence by the chase, by fishing,
by agriculture, etc.</p>

<p>We may <em class="e000I2">steal</em> them by breach of trust, by violence, by force,
fraud, war, etc.</p>

<p>If, confining ourselves to the circle of one or other of these two
categories, we find that the predominance of one of these methods
establishes so marked a difference in the character of nations, how
much greater must the difference be between a nation which lives
by production, and a nation which lives by spoliation?</p>

<p>For it is not one of our faculties only, but all of them, which
the necessity of providing for our subsistence brings into exercise;
and what can be more fitted to modify the social condition
of nations than what thus modifies all the human faculties?</p>

<p>This consideration, important as it is, has been so little regarded,
that I must dwell upon it for an instant.</p>

<p>The realization of an enjoyment or satisfaction presupposes
labour; whence it follows that spoliation, far from excluding production,
presupposes it and takes it for granted.</p>

<p>This consideration, it seems to me, ought to modify the partiality
which historians, poets, and novel-writers have displayed
for those heroic epochs which were not distinguished by what they
sneer at under the epithet of <em class="e000I2">industrialism</em>. In these days, as in
our own, men lived, subsisted; and labour must have done its office
then as now. Only there was this difference, that nations, classes,
and individuals succeeded in laying their share of the labour and
toil on the shoulders of other nations, other classes, and other individuals.</p>

<p>The characteristic of production is to bring out of nothing, if I
may so speak, the satisfactions and enjoyments which sustain and
embellish life; so that a man, or a nation, may multiply <em class="e000I2">ad infinitum</em>
these enjoyments, without inflicting privation on any other
man, or any other nation. So much is this the case, that a profound
study of the economic mechanism shows us that the success
<a id="p459" class="xxpn">[p459]</a> of one man’s labour opens up a field for the success of another’s
exertions.</p>

<p>The characteristic of spoliation, on the contrary, is this, that it
cannot confer a satisfaction on one without inflicting a corresponding
privation on another; for spoliation creates nothing, but displaces
what labour has created. It entails an absolute loss of the
exertions of both parties. So far, then, from adding to the enjoyments
of mankind, it diminishes these enjoyments, and confers them,
moreover, on those who have not merited them.</p>

<p>In order to produce, man must direct all his powers and faculties
to obtain the mastery over natural laws; for it is by this means
that he accomplishes his object. Hence, iron converted into a
ploughshare is the emblem of production.</p>

<p>To steal, on the other hand, man must direct all his powers and
faculties to obtain the mastery over his fellow-man; for it is by
this means that he attains his end. Hence, iron converted into a
sword is the emblem of spoliation.</p>

<p>Between the ploughshare, which brings plenty, and the sword,
which brings destruction and death, there is no greater difference
than between a nation of industrious workmen and a nation of
spoliators. They have, and can have, nothing whatever in common.
They have neither the same ideas, nor the same rules of
appreciation, nor the same tastes, manners, character, laws, morals,
or religion.</p>

<p>No more melancholy spectacle can present itself to the eye of
philanthropy than to see an industrial age putting forth all its
efforts, in the way of education, to get inoculated with the ideas,
the sentiments, the errors, the prejudices, the vices, of an era of
spoliation. Our own era is frequently accused of wanting consistency,
of displaying little accordance between the judgments that
are formed and the conduct that is pursued; and I believe that this
arises principally from the cause which I have just pointed out.</p>

<p>Spoliation, in the shape of War—that is to say, pure, simple,
barefaced spoliation—has its root deep in the human heart, in the
organization of man, in the universal motives which actuate the
social world, namely, desire of happiness and repugnance to pain,—in
short, in that principle of our nature called self-interest.</p>

<p>I am not sorry to find myself arraigning that principle, for I
have been accused of devoting to it an idolatrous worship, of representing
its effects as productive only of happiness to mankind,
and even of elevating it above the principle of sympathy, of disinterestedness,
and of self-sacrifice. In truth, I have not so
esteemed it; I have only proved beyond the possibility of doubt
<a id="p460" class="xxpn">[p460]</a> its existence and its omnipotence. I should ill appreciate that
omnipotence, and I should do violence to my own convictions, in
representing personal interest as the universal actuating motive of
the human race, did I fail now to point out the disturbing causes
to which it gives rise, just as I formerly pointed out the harmonious
laws of the social order which spring from it.</p>

<p>Man, as we have already said, has an invincible desire to support
himself, to improve his condition, and to attain happiness, or what
he conceives to be happiness, at least to approximate towards it.
For the same reason he shuns pain and toil.</p>

<p>Now labour, or the exertion we make in order to cause nature to
co-operate in production, is in itself toil or fatigue. For this reason,
it is repugnant to man, and he does not submit to it, except
for the sake of avoiding a still greater evil.</p>

<p>Some have maintained philosophically that labour is not an evil
but a good, and they are right, if we take into account its results.
It is a comparative good; or if it be an evil, it is an evil which
saves us from greater evils. This is precisely the reason why
men have so great a tendency to shun labour when they think
that, without having recourse to it, they may be able to reap its
results.</p>

<p>Others maintain that labour is <em class="e000I2">in itself</em> a good; and that, independently
of its productive results, it elevates, strengthens, and
purifies man’s character, and is to him a source of health and enjoyment.
All this is strictly true; and it is an additional evidence
to us of the marvellous fertility of those final intentions which the
Creator has displayed in all parts of His works. Apart altogether
from the productions which are its direct results, labour promises
to man, as a supplementary recompense, a sound mind in a sound
body; and it is not more true that idleness is the parent of every
vice than that labour is the parent of many virtues.</p>

<p>But this does not at all interfere with the natural and unconquerable
inclinations of the human heart, or with that feeling which
prompts us not to desire labour for its own sake, but to compare it
constantly with its results; not to desire to expend a great effort
on what can be accomplished with a smaller effort; not of two
efforts to choose the more severe. Nor is our endeavour to
diminish the relation which the effort bears to the result inconsistent
with our desire, when we have once acquired some leisure, to devote
that leisure to new labours suited to our tastes, with the
prospect of thus securing a new and additional recompense.</p>

<p>With reference to all this, universal facts are decisive. At all
times, and everywhere, we find man regarding labour as
<a id="p461" class="xxpn">[p461]</a> undesirable, and satisfaction as the thing in his condition which makes
him compensation for his labour. At all times, and everywhere,
we find him endeavouring to lighten his toil by calling in the aid,
whenever he can obtain it, of animals, of the wind, of water-power,
of steam, of natural forces, or, alas! of his fellow-creature, when
he succeeds in enslaving him. In this last case,—I repeat, for it
is too apt to be forgotten,—labour is not diminished, but displaced.<a
href="#FN_103" id="FNa_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>Man, being thus placed between two evils, want or labour, and
urged on by self-interest, seeks to discover whether, by some means
or other, he cannot get rid of both. It is then that spoliation presents
itself to him as a solution of the problem.</p>

<p>He says to himself: “I have not, it is true, any means of
procuring the things necessary for my subsistence and enjoyments—food,
clothing, and lodging—unless these things are previously
produced by labour. But it is by no means indispensable that
this should be <em class="e000I2">my own</em> labour. It is enough that they should be
produced by the labour of <em class="e000I2">some one</em>, provided I can get the
mastery.”</p>

<p>Such is the origin of war.</p>

<p>I shall not dwell upon its consequences.</p>

<p>When things come to this, that one man, or one nation, devotes
itself to labour, and another man, or another nation, waits on till
that labour is accomplished, in order to devote itself to rapine, we
can see at a glance how much human power is thrown away.</p>

<p>On the one hand, the spoliator has not succeeded as he desired
in getting quit of every kind of labour. Armed robbery exacts
efforts, and sometimes very severe efforts. While the producer
devotes his time to the creation of products fitted to yield satisfactions,
the spoliator employs his time in devising the means of
robbing him. But when the work of violence has been accomplished,
or attempted, the objects calculated to yield satisfaction
are neither more nor less abundant than before. They may minister
to the wants of a different set of people, but not of more wants.
Thus all the exertions which the spoliator has made with a view to
spoliation, and the exertions also which he has failed to make with
a view to production, are entirely lost, if not for him, at least for
society.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. In most cases an analogous loss takes place on
the side of the producer. It is not likely that he will wait for
the violence with which he is menaced without taking some
<a id="p462" class="xxpn">[p462]</a> precaution for his own protection; and all precautions of this kind—arms,
fortifications, munitions, drill—are labour, and labour lost
for ever, not to him who expects security from this labour, but
to mankind at large.</p>

<p>But should the producer, after undergoing this double labour,
not esteem himself able to resist the threatened violence, it is still
worse for society, and power is thrown away on a much greater
scale; for, in that case labour will be given up altogether, no one
being disposed to produce in order to be plundered.</p>

<p>If we regard the manner in which the human faculties are
affected on both sides, the moral consequences of spoliation will
be seen to be no less disastrous.</p>

<p>Providence has designed that man should devote himself to
pacific combats with natural agents, and should reap directly from
nature the fruits of his victory. When he obtains this mastery
over natural agents only by obtaining a mastery over his fellow-creatures,
his mission is changed, and quite another direction is
given to his faculties. It is seen how great the difference is
between the producer and the spoliator, as regards <em class="e000I2">foresight</em>—foresight
which becomes assimilated in some degree to <em class="e000I2">providence</em>,
for to <em class="e000I2">foresee</em> is also to <em class="e000I2">provide against</em> [<em class="e000I2">prévoir</em> c’est aussi
<em class="e000I2">pourvoir</em>].</p>

<p>The producer sets himself to learn the relation between cause
and effect. For this purpose, he studies the laws of the physical
world, and seeks to make them more and more useful auxiliaries.
If he turns his regards on his fellow-men, it is to foresee their
wants, and to provide for them, on condition of reciprocity.</p>

<p>The spoliator does not study nature. If he turns his regards on
his fellow-men, it is to watch them as the eagle watches his prey,
for the purpose of enfeebling and surprising them.</p>

<p>The same differences are observable in the other faculties, and
extend to men’s ideas.<a
href="#FN_104" id="FNa_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>Spoliation by means of war is not an accidental, isolated, and
transient fact; it is a fact so general and so constant as not to
give place, as regards permanence, to labour itself.</p>

<p>Point me out any country of the world where of two races,
conquerors and conquered, the one does not domineer over the
other. Show me in Europe, in Asia, or among the islands of the
sea, a favoured spot still occupied by the primitive inhabitants.
If migrations of population have spared no country, war has been
equally widespread.</p>

<p>Its traces are universal. Apart from rapine and bloodshed, <a id="p463" class="xxpn">[p463]</a>
public opinion outraged, and faculties and talents perverted, war
has everywhere left other traces behind it, among which we must
reckon slavery and aristocracy. . . . .&#160;.</p>

<p>Not only has the march of spoliation kept pace with the creation
of wealth, but the spoliators have seized upon accumulated
riches, upon capital in all its forms; and, in particular, they have
fixed their regards upon capital in the shape of landed property.
The last step was taking possession of man himself. For human
powers and faculties being the instruments of labour, they found
it a shorter method to lay hold of these powers and faculties, than
to seize upon their products.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>It is impossible to calculate to what extent these great events
have acted as disturbing causes, and as trammels on the natural
progress of the human race. If we take into account the sacrifice
of industrial power which war occasions, and the extent to which
the diminished results of that power are concentrated in the hands
of a limited number of conquerors, we may form to ourselves an
idea of the causes of the destitution of the masses,—a destitution
which in our days it is impossible to explain on the hypothesis of
liberty.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">How the warlike spirit is propagated.</em></p>

<p>Aggressive nations are subject to reprisals. They often attack
others; sometimes they defend themselves. When they act on
the defensive, they have on their side the feeling of justice, and
the sacredness of the cause in which they are engaged. They may
then exult in their courage, devotion, and patriotism. But, alas!
they carry these same sentiments into their offensive wars—and
where is their patriotism then?&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>When two races, the one victorious and idle, the other vanquished
and humiliated, occupy the same territory, everything
calculated to awaken desire or arouse popular sympathies falls
to the lot of the conquerors. Theirs are leisure, fêtes, taste for
the arts, wealth, military parade, tournaments, grace, elegance,
literature, poetry. For the conquered race, nothing remains but
ruined huts, squalid garments, the hard hand of labour, or the cold
hand of charity.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>The consequence is that the ideas and prejudices of the dominant
race, always associated with military force, come to constitute
public opinion. Men, women, and children, all unite in extolling
the soldier’s life in preference to that of the labourer, in preferring
war to industry, and spoliation to production. The vanquished
race shares the same sentiments, and when, at periods of transition,
it succeeds in getting the better of its oppressors, it shows
<a id="p464" class="xxpn">[p464]</a> itself disposed to imitate them. What is this imitation but
madness?&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">How war ends.</em></p>

<p>Spoliation, like Production, having its source in the human
heart, the laws of the social world would not be harmonious, even
to the limited extent for which I contend, if the latter did not
succeed in the long-run in overcoming the former.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. <a id="p465" class="xxpn">[p465]</a></p>

RESPONSIBILITY.</h2>

<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
There is a leading idea which runs through the whole of this
work, which pervades and animates every page and every line of
it; and that idea is embodied in the opening words of the Christian
Creed,—<em class="e00S02">I believe in God</em>.</p>

<p>Yes, if this work differs from those of some other Economists, it
is in this, that the latter appear to say, “We have but little faith
in Providence, for we see that the natural laws lead to an abyss.
And yet we say <em class="e000I2">laissez faire!</em> merely because we have still less
faith in ourselves, and because we see clearly that all human efforts
designed to arrest the action of these natural laws tend only to
hasten the catastrophe.”</p>

<p>Again, if this work differs from the writings of the Socialists, it
is in this, that the latter say, “We pretend to believe in God,
but in reality we believe only in ourselves; seeing that we have
no faith in the maxim, <em class="e000I2">laissez faire</em>, and that we all give forth
our social nostrums as infinitely superior to the plans of Providence.”</p>

<p>For my part, I say, <em class="e000I2">laissez faire</em>; in other
words, respect liberty,
and the human initiative,<a
href="#FN_105" id="FNa_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> . . .
 . . . . . . . . . . .
 . . . . . . . . . .&#160;.
<em class="e000I2">Responsibility</em>, <em class="e000I2">solidarity</em>;
mysterious laws, of <a id="p466" class="xxpn">[p466]</a> which, apart
from Revelation, it is impossible to appreciate the cause, but the
effects and infallible action of which, on the progress of society,
it is given us to appreciate—laws which, for the very reason that
man is sociable, are linked together and act together, although
they appear sometimes to run counter to each other; and which would
require to be viewed in their <em class="e000I2">ensemble</em>,
and in their common action, if science, with its feeble optics and
uncertain steps, were not reduced to method—that melancholy crutch
which constitutes its strength whilst it reveals its weakness.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Nosce te ipsum</em>—know thyself: this, according
to the oracle, is <a id="p467" class="xxpn">[p467]</a>
the beginning, the middle, and the end of the moral and political
sciences.</p>

<p>As we have elsewhere remarked, in what concerns man or
human society, Harmony can never mean Perfection, but only
Improvement. Now improvement or perfectibility implies always,
to a certain extent, imperfection in the future as well as in the
past. If man could ever find his way into the promised land of
<em class="e000I2">absolute Good</em>, he would no longer have occasion to use his understanding
and his senses—he would be no longer man.</p>

<p>Evil exists. It is inherent in human infirmity. It manifests
itself in the moral as in the material world; in the masses, as in
the individual; in the whole as in the part. But because the eye
may suffer and be lost, does the physiologist overlook the harmonious
mechanism of that admirable organ? Does he deny the
ingenious structure of the human body, because that body is subject
to pain, to disease, and to death—to such extremity of suffering
as caused Job, in the depth of his despair, “to say to corruption,
Thou art my father; and to the worm, Thou art my mother and my
sister”? In the same way, because the social order will never bring
mankind to the fancied haven of absolute good, is the economist
to refuse to recognise all that is marvellous in the organization of
the social order—an organization prepared with a view to the
constantly-increasing diffusion of knowledge, of morality, and of
happiness?</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Strange! that we should deny to economic science the same
right to admire the natural order of things which we concede to
physiology. For, after all, what difference is there between the
individual and the collective being, as regards the harmony displayed
by final causes? The individual, no doubt, comes into existence,
grows and is developed, educates and improves himself as life
advances, until the time comes when his light and life are to be
communicated to others. At that moment everything about him
is clothed in the hues of beauty; all breathes grace and joy; all is
expansion, affection, benevolence, love, and harmony. For a while,
his intelligence continues to be enlarged and confirmed, as if to
qualify him to be the guide of those whom he has just called to
tread the crooked paths of human existence. But soon his beauty
fades, his grace disappears, his senses are blunted, his body becomes
feeble, his memory clouded, his thoughts less bright; his affections
even (except in the case of some choice spirits) get clogged with
egotism, and lose that charm, that freshness, that sincerity and simplicity,
that depth and disinterestedness, which distinguished his
<a id="p468" class="xxpn">[p468]</a> earlier days;—the poetry of life has fled. In spite of all the
ingenious precautions which nature has taken to retard his dissolution—precautions
which physiology sums up in the phrase <em class="e000I2">vis
medicatrix</em>—he treads back the path of improvement, and loses, one
after another, all his acquisitions by the way; he goes on from privation
to privation, until he reaches that which is the greatest of
all, because it includes all. The genius of optimism itself can discover
nothing consolatory, nothing harmonious in this slow but
unavoidable decadence—in seeing that being once so proud and so
beautiful descending sadly into the tomb. . . . .&#160;. The
tomb!&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. But is not that the door of another
habitation?&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. It is thus, when science stops short,
that religion<a
href="#FN_106" id="FNa_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> renews, even for the individual, in another region,
the concordant harmonies which have been interrupted here.<a
href="#FN_107" id="FNa_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>Despite this fatal <em class="e000I2">dénoûment</em>, does physiology cease to see in the
human body the most perfect masterpiece which ever proceeded
from its Creator’s hands?</p>

<p>But if the social body is liable to suffering, if it may suffer even
to death, it is not for that reason finally condemned. Let men say
what they will, it has not, in perspective, after having been elevated
to its apogee, an inevitable decline. The crash of empires
even is not the retrogradation of humanity, and the ancient models
of civilisation have only been dissolved in order to make room for
a civilisation still more advanced. Dynasties may be extinguished;
the forms of government may be changed; yet the progress of the
human race may not the less be continued. The fall of States is
like the fall of leaves in autumn. It fertilizes the soil; contributes
to the return of spring; and promises to future generations a richer
vegetation, and more abundant harvests. Nay, even in a purely
national point of view, this theory of necessary decadence is as false
as it is antiquated. In the life of no people can we possibly perceive
any cause of inevitable decline. The analogy which has so
frequently given rise to a comparison between a nation and an individual,
and led men to attribute to the one as to the other an
infancy and an old age, is nothing better than a false metaphor. A
community is being incessantly renewed. Let its institutions be
elastic and flexible, so that in place of coming in collision with
<a id="p469" class="xxpn">[p469]</a> those new powers to which the human mind gives birth, they shall
be so organized as to admit of this expansion of intellectual energy
and accommodate themselves to it; and we see no reason why
such institutions should not flourish in eternal youth. But whatever
may be thought of the fragility and fall of empires, it must
never be forgotten that society, which in its aggregate represents
the human race, is constituted upon more solid bases. The more
we study it, the more we shall be convinced that it too, like the
human body, is provided with a <em class="e000I2">curative force</em>, a <em class="e000I2">vis medicatrix</em>,
which delivers it from the evils which afflict it; and that it carries
in its bosom, moreover, a <em class="e000I2">progressive force</em>; and is by the latter
urged on to improvements to which we can assign no limits.</p>

<p>If individual evil, then, does not weaken or invalidate physiological
harmony, still less does collective evil weaken or invalidate
social harmony.</p>

<p>But how are we to reconcile the existence of evil with the
infinite goodness of God? I cannot explain what I do not understand.</p>

<p>All I shall say is, that this solution can no more be exacted from
Political Economy than from Anatomy. These sciences, which
are alike sciences of observation, study man as he is, without
asking the Creator to reveal His impenetrable secrets.</p>

<p>Thus, I again repeat, harmony does not correspond with the idea
of absolute perfection, but with that of indefinite improvement. It
has pleased God to attach suffering to our nature, seeing that He
has designed that in us feebleness should be anterior to force,
ignorance to science, want to satisfaction, effort to result, acquisition
to possession, destitution to wealth, error to truth, experience
to foresight. I submit without murmuring to this ordinance, being
able, moreover, to imagine no other combination. But if, by a
mechanism as simple as it is ingenious, He has provided <em class="e000I2">that all
men should approximate to a common level, which is continually
rising</em>, if He assures them—by the very action of what we denominate
evil—both of the duration and the diffusion of progress,
then am I not only content to bow myself under His bountiful and
almighty hand,—I bless that hand, I worship it, I adore it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have seen certain schools arise which have taken advantage
of the insolubility (humanly speaking) of this question to embroil
all others, as if it were given to our finite intelligence to
<a id="p470" class="xxpn">[p470]</a> comprehend and reconcile things which are infinite. Placing over the
portal of social science this sentence, <em class="e000I2">God cannot desire evil</em>, they
arrive at the following series of conclusions: “Evil exists in
society; then society is not organized according to the designs of
God. Let us change, and change again, and change continually
this organization. Let us try about, and make experiments, until
we have effaced all trace of suffering from the world. By that
sign we shall know that the kingdom of God has come.”</p>

<p>Nor is this all. These schools have been led to exclude from
their social plans liberty as well as suffering, for liberty implies
the possibility of error, and consequently the possibility of evil.
Addressing their fellow-men, they say, “Allow us to organize
you—don’t you interfere—cease to compare, to judge, to decide
anything by yourselves and for yourselves. We abhor the <em class="e000I2">laissez
faire</em>; but we ask you to let things alone, and to let us alone. If
we succeed in conducting you to perfect happiness, the infinite
goodness of God will be vindicated.”</p>

<p>Contradiction, inconsistency, presumption,—we ask which is
most apparent in such language?</p>

<p>One sect among others, not very philosophical, but very noisy,
promises to mankind unmixed felicity. Only deliver over to that
sect the government of the human race, and in virtue of certain
formulas, it makes bold to rid men of every painful sensation.</p>

<p>But if you do not accord a blind faith to the promises of that
sect, then, bringing forward that formidable and insoluble problem
which has vexed philosophy since the beginning of the world,
they summon you to reconcile the existence of evil with the
infinite goodness of God. Do you hesitate? they accuse you of
impiety.</p>

<p>Fourier rings the changes on this theme till he exhausts all its
combinations.</p>

<p>“<em class="e000I2">Either God has not been able</em> to give us a social code of attraction,
of justice, of truth, and of unity; in which case He has been
unjust in giving us wants without the means of satisfying them.”</p>

<p>“<em class="e000I2">Or He has not desired to give it us</em>; and in that case He has
deliberately persecuted us by creating designedly wants which it
is impossible to satisfy:”</p>

<p>“<em class="e000I2">Or He is able, and has not desired</em>; in which case the principle
of good would rival the principle of evil, having the power to
establish good, and preferring to establish evil:” <a id="p471" class="xxpn">[p471]</a></p>

<p>“<em class="e000I2">Or He has desired and has not been able</em>; in which case He is
incapable of governing us, acknowledging and desiring good, but
not having the power to establish it:”</p>

<p>“<em class="e000I2">Or He has been neither able nor willing</em>; in which case the
principle of good is below the principle of evil, etc.:”</p>

<p>“<em class="e000I2">Or He has been both able and willing</em>; in which case the code
exists, and it is for us to promulgate it, etc.”</p>

<p>And Fourier is the prophet of this new revelation. Let us
deliver ourselves up to him and to his disciples: Providence
will then be justified, sensibility will change its nature, and
suffering will disappear from the earth.</p>

<p>But how, I would ask, do these apostles of absolute good, these
hardy logicians, who exclaim continually that “God being perfect,
His work must be perfect also;” and who accuse us of impiety
because we resign ourselves to human imperfection,—how, I say,
do these men not perceive that, on the most favourable hypothesis,
they are as impious as we are? I should like, indeed, that, under
the reign of Messieurs Considérant, Hennequin, etc., no one in the
world should ever lose his mother, or suffer from the toothache,—in
which case he also might chant the litany, <em class="e000I2">Either God has not
been able or has not been willing</em>; I should like much that evil
were to take flight to the infernal regions, retreating before the
broad daylight of the Socialist revelation—that one of their plans,
<em class="e000I2">phalanstère</em>, <em class="e000I2">crédit gratuit</em>, <em class="e000I2">anarchie</em>, <em class="e000I2">triade</em>,
<em class="e000I2">atelier social</em>,<a
href="#FN_108" id="FNa_108" class="fnanchor">108</a>
and so forth, had the power to rid us of all future evils. But would
it annihilate suffering in the past? The infinite, observe, has
no limits; and if there has existed on the earth since the beginning
of the world a single sufferer, that is enough to render
the problem of the infinite goodness of God insoluble in their point
of view.</p>

<p>Let us beware, then, of linking the science of the finite to the
mysteries of the infinite. Let us apply to the one reason and
observation, and leave the other in the domain of revelation and
of faith.</p>

<p>In all respects, and in every aspect, man is imperfect. In this
world, at least, he encounters limits in all directions, and touches
the finite at every point. His force, his intelligence, his affections,
his life, have in them nothing absolute, and belong to a
material mechanism which is subject to fatigue, to decay, and to
death.</p>

<p>Not only is this so, but our imperfection is so great that we cannot
even imagine perfection as existing either in ourselves or in the
external world. Our minds are so much out of proportion to this
idea of perfection that all our efforts to seize it are vain. The
oftener we try to grasp it, the oftener it escapes us, and is lost in
<a id="p472" class="xxpn">[p472]</a> inextricable contradictions. Show me a perfect man, and you will
show me a man who is exempt from suffering, and who has consequently
neither wants, nor desires, nor sensations, nor sensibility,
nor nerves, nor muscles; who can be ignorant of nothing, and
consequently has neither the faculty of attention, nor judgment,
nor reasoning, nor memory, nor imagination, nor brains; in short,
you will show me a being who does not exist.</p>

<p>Thus, in whatever aspect we regard man, we must regard him
as being subject to suffering. We must admit that evil has
entered as one spring of action into the providential plan; and in
place of seeking by chimerical means to annihilate it, our business
is to study the part which it has to play, and the mission on
which it is sent.</p>

<p>When it pleased God to create a being made up of wants, and
of faculties to supply these wants, it was at the same time decreed
that this being should be subject to suffering; for, apart from
suffering, we could form no idea of wants, and, apart from wants,
we could form no idea of utility, or of the use and object of any
of our faculties. All that constitutes our greatness has its root in
what constitutes our weakness.</p>

<p>Urged on by innumerable impulses, and indued with an intelligence
which enlightens our exertions, and enables us to appreciate
their results, we have <em class="e000I2">free will</em> to guide and direct us.</p>

<p>But free will implies error as possible, and error in its turn
implies suffering as its inevitable effect. I defy any one to tell
me what it is to <em class="e000I2">choose freely</em>, if it be not to run the risk of making
a bad choice, and what it is to make a bad choice if it be not to
prepare the way for suffering.</p>

<p>And this is, no doubt, the reason why those schools who are
content with nothing less than absolute good are all materialist
and fatalist. They are unable to admit free will. They see that
liberty of acting proceeds from liberty of choosing; that liberty
of choosing supposes the possibility of error; and that the possibility
of error is the possibility of evil. Now, in an artificial
society, such as our <em class="e000I2">organisateurs</em> invent, evil cannot make its
appearance. For that reason, men must be exempted from the
possibility of error; and the surest means to accomplish that is to
deprive them of the faculty of acting and choosing—in other words,
of free will. It has been truly said that Socialism is despotism
incarnate.</p>

<p>In presence of these fooleries, it may be asked, By what right
does the organizer of artificial systems venture to think, act, and
choose, not only for himself, but for every one else? for, after all
<a id="p473" class="xxpn">[p473]</a> he belongs to the human race, and in that respect is fallible; and
he is so much the more fallible in proportion as he pretends to
extend the range of his science and his will.</p>

<p>No doubt the <em class="e000I2">organisateur</em> finds this objection radically unfounded,
inasmuch as it confounds him with the rest of mankind.
But he who professes to discover the defects of the Divine workmanship,
and has undertaken to recast it, is more than a man; he
is an oracle, and more than an oracle.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>Socialism has two elements: the frenzy of contradiction, and
the madness of pride!</p>

<p>But when free will, which is the foundation of the whole argument,
is denied, is not this the proper place to demonstrate its
existence? I shall take good care not to enter upon any such
demonstration. Every one feels that his will is free, and that is
enough. I feel this, not vaguely, but a hundred times more
intensely than if it had been demonstrated to me by Aristotle or
by Euclid. I feel it with conscious joy when I have made a choice
which does me honour; with remorse, when I have made a choice
which degrades me. I find, moreover, that all men by their
conduct affirm their belief in free will, although some deny it in
their writings.<a
href="#FN_109" id="FNa_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> All men compare motives, deliberate, determine,
retract, try to foresee; all give advice, are indignant at injustice,
admire acts of devotion. Then all acknowledge in themselves and
in others the existence of free will, without which, choice, advice,
foresight, morality, virtue, are impossible. Let us take care how
we seek to demonstrate what is admitted by universal practice.
Absolute fatalists are no more to be found, even at Constantinople,
than absolute sceptics are to be met with at Alexandria. Those
who proclaim themselves such may be fools enough to try to
persuade others, but they are powerless to convince themselves.
They prove with much subtlety that they have no will of their
own; but when we see that they act as if they had it, we need not
dispute with them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here, then, we are placed in the midst of nature and of our
fellow-men—urged on by impulses, wants, appetites, desires—provided
with various faculties enabling us to operate on man and on
<a id="p474" class="xxpn">[p474]</a> things—determined to action by our free will—indued with intelligence,
which is perfectible and therefore imperfect, and which,
if it enlightens us, may also deceive us with reference to the consequences
of our actions.</p>

<p>Every human action—giving rise to a series of good or bad
consequences, of which some fall back on the agent, and others
affect his family, his neighbours, his fellow-citizens, and sometimes
mankind at large—every such action causes the vibration of two
chords, the sounds of which are oracular utterances—Responsibility
and Solidarity.</p>

<p>As regards the man who acts, Responsibility is the natural link
which exists between the act and its consequences. It is a complete
system of <em class="e000I2">inevitable</em> Rewards and Punishments which no man
has invented, which acts with all the regularity of the great natural
laws, and which may, consequently, be regarded as of Divine
institution. The evident object of Responsibility is to restrain the
number of hurtful actions, and increase the number of such as are
useful.</p>

<p>This mechanism, which is at once corrective and progressive,
remunerative and retributive, is so simple, so near us, so identified
with our whole being, so perpetually in action, that not only can
we not ignore it, but we see that, like Evil, it is one of those
phenomena without which our whole life would be to us unintelligible.</p>

<p>The book of Genesis tells us that, the first man having been
driven from the terrestrial paradise, because he had learned to
distinguish between good and evil, <em class="e000I2">sciens bonum et malum</em>, God
pronounced this sentence on him: <em class="e000I2">In laboribus comedes ex terrâ
cunctis diebus vitæ tuæ. Spinas et tribulos germinabit tibi. In
sudore vultûs tui vesceris pane, donec revertaris in terram de quâ
sumptus es: quia pulvis es, et in pulverem reverteris.</em><a
href="#FN_110" id="FNa_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<p>Here, then, we have good and evil—or human nature. Here we
have acts and habits producing good or bad consequences—or
human nature. Here we have labour, sweat, thorns, tribulation,
and death—or human nature.</p>

<p>Human nature, I say; for to choose, to be mistaken, to suffer,
to rectify our errors—in a word, all the elements which make up
the idea of Responsibility—are so inherent in our sensitive, rational,
and free nature, they are so much of the essence of that nature
<a id="p475" class="xxpn">[p475]</a> itself, that I defy the most fertile imagination to conceive for man
another mode of existence.</p>

<p>That man might have lived in an Eden, <em class="e000I2">in paradiso voluptatis</em>,
ignorant of good and evil, we can indeed believe, but we cannot
comprehend it, so profoundly has our nature been transformed.</p>

<p>We find it impossible to separate the idea of <em class="e000I2">life</em> from that of
sensibility; that of sensibility from that of <em class="e000I2">pleasure</em> and <em class="e000I2">pain</em>;
that of pleasure and pain from that of <em class="e000I2">reward</em> and <em class="e000I2">punishment</em>;
that of <em class="e000I2">intelligence</em> from that of <em class="e000I2">liberty</em> and <em class="e000I2">choice</em>, and all these
ideas from the idea of Responsibility; for it is the aggregate of
all these ideas which gives us the idea of Being or Existence, so
that when we think upon God, our reason, which tells us that He
is incapable of suffering, remains confounded—so inseparable are
our notions of sensibility and <em class="e000I2">existence</em>.</p>

<p>It is this undoubtedly which renders <em class="e000I2">Faith</em> the necessary complement
of our destinies. It is the only bond which is possible
between the creature and the Creator, seeing that God is, and
always will be, to our reason, incomprehensible, <em class="e000I2">Deus absconditus</em>.</p>

<p>In order to be convinced how hard Responsibility presses us,
and shuts us in on every side, we have only to attend to the most
simple facts.</p>

<p>Fire burns us; the collision of bodies bruises us. If we were
not indued with sensibility, or if our sensibility were not painfully
affected by the approach of fire, and by rude contact with other
bodies, we should be exposed to death every moment.</p>

<p>From earliest infancy to extreme old age, our life is only a long
apprenticeship. By frequently falling, we learn to walk. By
rude and reiterated experiments, we are taught to avoid heat, cold,
hunger, thirst, excess. Do not let us complain of the roughness
of this experience. If it were not so, it would teach us nothing.</p>

<p>The same thing holds in the social order. From the unhappy
consequences of cruelty, of injustice, of fear, of violence, of deceit,
of idleness, we learn to be gentle, just, brave, moderate, truthful,
and industrious. Experience is protracted; it will never come to
an end; but it will never cease to be efficacious.</p>

<p>Man being so constituted, it is impossible that we should not
recognise in responsibility the mainspring to which social progress
is specially confided. It is the crucible in which experience is
elaborated. They, then, who believe in the superiority of times
past, like those who despair of the future, fall into the most manifest
contradiction. Without being aware of it, they extol error,
and calumniate knowledge. It is as if they said, “The more I
have learnt, the less I know. The more clearly I discern what is
<a id="p476" class="xxpn">[p476]</a> hurtful, the more I shall be exposed to it.” Were humanity constituted
on such a basis as this, it would in a short time cease to
exist.</p>

<p>Man’s starting-point is ignorance and inexperience. The farther
we trace back the chain of time, the more destitute we find men of
that knowledge which is fitted to direct their choice,—of knowledge
which can be acquired only in one of two ways: by reflection
or by experience.</p>

<p>Now it so happens that man’s every action includes, not one
consequence only, but a series of consequences. Sometimes the first
is good, and the others bad; sometimes the first is bad, and the
others good. From one of our determinations there may proceed
good and bad consequences, combined in variable proportions. We
may venture to term <em class="e000I2">vicious</em> those actions which produce more
bad than good effects, and <em class="e000I2">virtuous</em> those which produce a greater
amount of good than of evil.</p>

<p>When one of our actions produces a first consequence which we
approve, followed by many other consequences which are hurtful,
so that the aggregate of bad predominates over the aggregate of
good, such an action tends to limit and restrain itself, and to be
abandoned in proportion as we acquire more foresight.</p>

<p>Men naturally perceive the immediate consequences of their
actions before they perceive those consequences which are more
remote. Whence it follows that what we have denominated vicious
acts are more multiplied in times of ignorance. Now the repetition
of the same acts constitutes habit. Ages of ignorance, then, are
ages of bad habits.</p>

<p>Consequently, they are ages of bad laws, for acts which are repeated,
habits which are general, constitute manners, upon which
laws are modelled, and of which, so to speak, they are the official
expression.</p>

<p>How is this ignorance to be put an end to? How can men be
taught to know the second, the third, and all the subsequent consequences
of their acts and their habits?</p>

<p>The first means is the exercise of that faculty of discerning and
reasoning which Providence has vouchsafed them.</p>

<p>But there is another still more sure and efficacious,—experience.
When the act is once done, the consequences follow inevitably.
The first effect is good; for it is precisely to obtain that result that
the act is done. But the second may inflict suffering, the third still
greater suffering, and so on.</p>

<p>Then men’s eyes are opened, and light begins to appear. That
action is not repeated; we sacrifice the good produced by the first
<a id="p477" class="xxpn">[p477]</a> and immediate consequence, for fear of the still greater evil which
the subsequent consequences entail. If the act has become a habit,
and if we have not power to give it up, we at least give way to it
with hesitation and repugnance, and after an inward conflict. We
do not recommend it; on the contrary, we blame it, and persuade
our children against it; and we are certainly on the road of progress.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the act is one which is useful, but from
which we refrain, because its first, and only known, consequence
is painful, and we are ignorant of the favourable ulterior consequences,
experience teaches us the effects of abstaining from it. A
savage, for instance, has had enough to eat. He does not foresee
that he will be hungry to-morrow. Why should he labour to-day?
To work is present pain—no need of foresight to know that. He
therefore continues idle. But the day passes, another succeeds,
and as it brings hunger, he must then work under the spur of
necessity. This is a lesson which, frequently repeated, cannot
fail to develop foresight. By degrees idleness is regarded in its
true light. We brand it; we warn the young against it. Public
opinion is now on the side of industry.</p>

<p>But in order that experience should afford us this lesson, in
order that it should fulfil its mission, develop foresight, explain the
series of consequences which flow from our actions, pave the way
to good habits, and restrain bad ones—in a word, in order that experience
should become an effective instrument of progress and
moral improvement—the law of Responsibility must come into
operation. The bad consequences must make themselves felt, and
<em class="e000I2">evil</em> must for the moment chastise us.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it would be better that evil had no existence; and
it might perhaps be so if man was constituted differently from what
he is. But taking man as he is, with his wants, his desires, his
sensibility, his free will, his power of choosing and erring, his
faculty of bringing into play a cause which necessarily entails consequences
which it is not in our power to elude as long as the cause
exists; in such circumstances, the only way of removing the cause
is to enlighten the will, rectify the choice, abandon the vicious act
or the vicious habit; and nothing can effect this but the law of
Responsibility.</p>

<p>We may affirm, then, that man being constituted as he is, evil
is not only necessary but useful. It has a mission, and enters into
the universal harmony. Its mission is to destroy its own cause,
to limit its own operation, to concur in the realization of good, and
to stimulate progress. <a id="p478" class="xxpn">[p478]</a></p>

<p>We may elucidate this by some examples which the subject which
now engages us—Political Economy—presents.</p>

<p>Responsibility guards itself by three sanctions:—</p>

<p>1<em class="e000I2">st</em>, <em class="e000I2">The natural sanction</em>; which is that of which I have just
been speaking—the necessary suffering or recompense which certain
acts and habits entail.</p>

<p>2<em class="e000I2">d</em>, <em class="e000I2">The religious sanction</em>; or the punishments and rewards of
another life, which are annexed to acts and habits, according as
they are vicious or virtuous.</p>

<p>3<em class="e000I2">d</em>, <em class="e000I2">The legal sanction</em>; or the punishments and rewards decreed
beforehand by society.</p>

<p>Of these three sanctions, I confess that the one which appears to
me fundamental is the first. In saying this I cannot fail to run
counter to sentiments which I respect; but I must be permitted
to declare my opinion.</p>

<p>Is an act vicious because a revelation from above has declared it
to be so? Or has revelation declared it vicious because it produces
consequences which are bad? These questions will probably always
form a subject of controversy between the philosophical and the
religious mind.</p>

<p>I believe that Christianity can range itself on the side of those
who answer the last of these two questions in the affirmative.
Christianity itself tells us that it has not come to oppose the
natural law, but to confirm it.<a
href="#FN_112" id="FNa_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> We can scarcely admit that God,
who is the supreme principle of order, should have made an arbitrary
classification of human actions, that He should have denounced
punishment on some, and promised reward to others, and this
without any regard to the effects of these actions, that is to say, to
their discordance, or concordance, in the universal harmony. <a id="p479" class="xxpn">[p479]</a></p>

<p>When He said, “Thou shalt not kill—thou shalt not steal,” no
doubt He had in view to prohibit certain acts because they were
hurtful to man and to society, which are His work.</p>

<p>Regard to consequences is so powerful a consideration with man
that if he belonged to a religion that forbade acts which universal
experience proved to be useful, or that sanctioned the observance
of habits palpably hurtful, I believe that such a religion could
not be maintained, but that it would at length give way before
the progress of knowledge. Men could not long suppose that
the deliberate design of God was to cause evil and to interdict
good.</p>

<p>The question which I broach here has perhaps no very important
bearing on Christianity, since it ordains only what is
good in itself, and forbids only what is bad.</p>

<p>But the question I am now examining is this, whether in principle
the religious sanction goes to confirm the natural sanction,
or whether the natural sanction goes for nothing in presence of the
religious sanction, and should give way to the latter when they
come into collision.</p>

<p>Now, if I am not mistaken, the tendency of ministers of religion
is to pay little attention to the natural sanction. For this they
have an unanswerable reason: “God has ordained this; God has
forbidden that.” There is no longer any room left for reasoning,
for God is infallible and omnipotent. Although the act should
lead to the destruction of the world, we must march on like blind
men, just as we would do if God addressed us personally, and
showed us heaven and hell.</p>

<p>It may happen, even in the true religion, that actions in themselves
innocent are forbidden by Divine authority. To exact
interest for money, for example, has been pronounced sinful. Had
mankind given obedience to that prohibition, the race would long
since have disappeared from the face of the earth. For without
interest the accumulation of capital is impossible; without capital
there can be no co-operation of anterior and present labour; without
this co-operation there can be no society; and without society
man cannot exist.</p>

<p>On the other hand, on examining the subject of interest more
nearly, we are convinced that not only is it useful in its general
effects, but that there is in it nothing contrary to charity and
truth—certainly not more than there is in the stipend of a minister
of religion, and less than in certain perquisites belonging to his
office.</p>

<p>Thus, all the power of the Church has not been able for an
<a id="p480" class="xxpn">[p480]</a> instant to supersede, in this respect, the nature of things. The
most which has been accomplished is to cause to be disguised one
of the forms, and that the least usual form, of exacting interest, in
a number of very trifling transactions.</p>

<p>In the same way, as regards precepts; when the Gospel says,
“Unto him who smiteth thee on the one cheek, offer also the
other,” it gives a precept which, if taken literally, would destroy
the right of legitimate defence in the individual, and consequently
in society. Now, without this right, the existence of the human
race is impossible.</p>

<p>And what has happened? For eighteen hundred years this
saying has been repeated as a mere conventionalism.</p>

<p>But there is a still graver consideration. There are false religions
in the world. These necessarily admit precepts and prohibitions
which are in antagonism with the natural sanctions attached to
certain acts. Now, of all the means which have been given us to
distinguish, in a matter so important, the true from the false, that
which emanates from God from that which proceeds from imposture,
none is more certain, more decisive, than an examination of
the good or bad consequences which a doctrine is calculated to
have on the advancement and progress of mankind—<em class="e000I2">a fructibus
eorum cognoscetis eos</em>.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Legal sanction.</em>—Nature having prepared a system of punishments
and rewards, in the shape of the effects which necessarily
proceed from each act and from each habit, what is the province
of human law? There are only three courses it can take—to
allow Responsibility to act, to chime in with it, or to oppose it.</p>

<p>It seems to me beyond doubt that when a legal sanction is
brought into play, it ought only to be to give more force, regularity,
certainty, and efficacy to the natural sanction. These two powers
should co-operate, and not run counter to each other.</p>

<p>For example, if fraud is in the first instance profitable to him
who has recourse to it, in the long-run it is more frequently fatal
to him; for it injures his credit, his honour, and his reputation.
It creates around him distrust and suspicion. It is, besides,
always hurtful to the man who is the victim of it. Finally, it
alarms society, and obliges it to employ part of its force in expensive
precautions. The sum of evil, then, far exceeds the sum of
good. This is what constitutes natural Responsibility, which acts
constantly as a preventive and repressive check. We can understand,
however, that the community does not choose to depend
altogether on the slow action of necessary responsibility, and
judges it fit to add a legal sanction to the natural sanction. In
<a id="p481" class="xxpn">[p481]</a> that case, we may say that the legal sanction is only the natural
sanction organized and reduced to rule. It renders punishment
more immediate and more certain; it gives more publicity and
authenticity to facts; it surrounds the suspected party with
guarantees, and affords him a regular opportunity to exculpate
himself if there be room for it; it rectifies the errors of public
opinion, and calms down individual vengeance by substituting for
it public retribution. In fine—and this perhaps is the essential
thing—it does not destroy the lessons of experience.</p>

<p>We cannot, then, say that the legal sanction is illogical in
principle, when it advances alongside the natural sanction and
concurs in the same result. It does not follow, however, that the
legal sanction ought in every case to be substituted for the natural
sanction, and that human law is justified by the consideration
alone that it acts in the sense of Responsibility.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>The artificial distribution of punishments and rewards includes
in itself, and at the expense of the community, an amount of
inconvenience which it is necessary to take into account. The
machinery of the legal sanction comes from men, is worked by
men, and is costly.</p>

<p>Before submitting an action or a habit to organized repression,
there is always this question to be asked:—</p>

<p>Does the excess of good which is obtained by the addition of
legal repression to natural repression compensate the evil which is
inherent in the repressive machinery?</p>

<p>In other words, is the evil of artificial repression greater or less
than the evil of impunity?</p>

<p>In the case of theft, of murder, of the greater part of crimes and
delicts, the question admits of no doubt. Every nation of the
earth represses these crimes by public force.</p>

<p>But when we have to do with a habit which it is difficult to
account for, and which may spring from moral causes of delicate
appreciation, the question is different, and it may very well be
that, although this habit is universally esteemed hurtful and
vicious, the law should remain neuter, and hand it over to natural
responsibility.</p>

<p>In the first place, this is the course which the law ought to take
in the case of an action or a habit which is doubtful, which one
part of the population thinks good and another part bad. You
think me wrong in following the Catholic ritual; I think you
wrong in adopting the Lutheran faith. Let God judge of that.
Why should I aim a blow at you, or why should you aim a blow
<a id="p482" class="xxpn">[p482]</a> at me? If it is not right that we should strike at each other, how
can it be right that we should delegate a third party, the depositary
of the public force, to chastise one of us for the satisfaction of the
other?</p>

<p>You allege that I am wrong in teaching my child the moral and
natural sciences; I believe that you are wrong in teaching your
child Greek and Latin exclusively. Let us act on both sides
according to our feeling of what is right. Let our families be acted
on by the law of Responsibility. That law will punish the one
who is wrong. Do not invoke human law, which may punish the
one who is right.</p>

<p>You assert that I would do better to pursue such or such a career,
to work according to your process, to employ an iron in place of a
wooden plough, to sow thin in place of sowing thick, to purchase
in the East rather than in the West. I maintain just the contrary.
I have made all my calculations; and surely I am more interested
than you in not falling into any mistake in matters upon the right
ordering of which my welfare, my existence, and the happiness
of my family depend, while in your case they interest only your
<em class="e000I2">amour-propre</em> and the credit of your systems. Give me as much
advice as you please, but constrain me to nothing. I decide upon
<em class="e000I2">my own proper risk and peril</em>, and surely that is enough without
the tyrannical intervention of law.</p>

<p>We see that, in almost all the important actions of life, it is
necessary to respect free will, to rely on the individual judgment
of men, on that inward light which God has given them
for their guidance, and after that to leave Responsibility to do its
own work.</p>

<p>The intervention of law in analogous cases, over and above the
very great inconvenience of opening the way equally to error and
to truth, has the still greater inconvenience of paralyzing intelligence
itself, of extinguishing that light which is the inheritance
of humanity and the pledge of progress.</p>

<p>But even when an action, a habit, a practice is acknowledged by
public good sense to be bad, vicious, and immoral, when it is so
beyond doubt; when those who give themselves up to it are the
first to blame themselves,—that is not enough to justify the intervention
of law. As I have already said, it is necessary also to
know if, in adding to the bad consequences of this vice the bad
consequences inherent in all legal repression, we do not produce,
in the long-run, a sum of evil which exceeds the good which the
legal sanction adds to the natural sanction.</p>

<p>We might examine, for instance, the evils which would result
<a id="p483" class="xxpn">[p483]</a> from the application of the legal sanction to the repression of idleness,
prodigality, avarice, egotism, cupidity, ambition.</p>

<p>Let us take the case of idleness.</p>

<p>This is a very natural inclination, and there are not wanting men
who join the chorus of the Italians when they celebrate the <em class="e000I2">dolce
far niente</em>, and of Rousseau, when he says, <em class="e000I2">Je suis paresscux avec
délices</em>. We cannot doubt, then, that idleness is attended with a
certain amount of enjoyment. Were it not so, in fact, there would
be no idleness in the world.</p>

<p>And yet there flows from this inclination a host of evils, so
much so that the wisdom of nations has embodied itself in the
proverb that <em class="e000I2">Idleness is the parent of every vice</em>.</p>

<p>The evils of idleness infinitely surpass the good; and it is
necessary that the law of Responsibility should act in this
matter with some energy, either as a lesson or as a spur, seeing
that it is in fact by labour that the world has reached the state of
civilisation which it has now attained.</p>

<p>Now, considered either as a lesson or as a spur to action, what
would a legal sanction add to the providential sanction? Suppose
we had a law to punish idleness. In what precise degree would
such a law quicken the national activity?</p>

<p>If we could find this out, we should have an exact measure of
the benefit resulting from the law. I confess I can form no idea
of this part of the problem. But we must ask, at what price
would this benefit, whatever it were, be purchased; and surely
little reflection is needed in order to see that the certain inconveniences
of legal repression would far exceed its problematical
advantages.</p>

<p>In the first place, there are in France thirty-six millions of
inhabitants. It would be necessary to exercise over them all
a rigorous <em class="e000I2">surveillance</em>, to follow them into their fields, their
workshops, to their domestic circles. Think of the number of
functionaries, the increase of taxes, etc., which would be the
result.</p>

<p>Then, those who are now industrious—and the number, thank
God, is great—would be, no less than the idle, subjected to this
intolerable inquisition. It is surely an immense inconvenience to
subject a hundred innocent people to degrading measures, in order
to punish one guilty person whom nature has herself taken it in
hand to chastise.</p>

<p>And then, when does idleness begin? In the case of each man
brought to justice, the most minute and delicate inquiries would
be necessary. Was the accused really idle, or did he merely take
<a id="p484" class="xxpn">[p484]</a> necessary repose? Was he sick, or was he meditating, or was he
saying his prayers, etc.? How could we appreciate all those
shades of difference? Did he work harder and longer in the
morning in order to have a little more time at his disposal in the
evening? How many witnesses, judges, juries, policemen, would
be needed, how much resistance, espionage, and hatred would be
engendered!&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>Next we should have the chapter of judicial blunders. How
great an amount of idleness would escape! and, in return, how
many industrious people would go to redeem in prison the inactivity
of a day by the inactivity of a month!</p>

<p>With these consequences and many others before our eyes, we
say, Let natural Responsibility do its own work. And we do well
in saying so.</p>

<p>The Socialists, who never decline to have recourse to despotism
in order to accomplish their ends—for the end is everything with
them—have branded Responsibility under the name of <em class="e000I2">individualism</em>,—and
have then tried to annihilate it, and absorb it in
the sphere of action of a <em class="e000I2">solidarity</em> extended beyond all natural
bounds.</p>

<p>The consequences of this perversion of the two great springs of
human perfectibility are fatal. There is no longer any dignity,
any liberty, for man. For, from the moment that the man who
acts is not personally answerable for the good or bad consequences
of his actions, his right to act singly and individually no longer
exists. If each movement of the individual is to reflect back the
series of its effects on society at large, the initiative of each such
movement can no longer be left to the individual—it belongs to
society. The community alone must decide all, and regulate all,—education,
food, wages, amusements, locomotion, affections,
families, etc. Now, the law is the voice of Society; the law is
the legislator. Here, then, we have a flock and a shepherd,—less
than that even, inert matter, and a workman. We see, then, to
what point the suppression of Responsibility and of individualism
would lead us.</p>

<p>To conceal this frightful design from the eyes of the vulgar, it
was necessary to flatter their selfish passions by declaiming against
egotism. To the suffering classes Socialism says, “Do not trouble
yourselves to examine whether your sufferings are to be ascribed
to the law of Responsibility. There are fortunate people in the
world, and in virtue of the law of Solidarity they ought to share
their prosperity with you.” And for the purpose of paving the
way to the degrading level of a factitious, official, legal,
con <a id="p485" class="xxpn">[p485]</a> strained, and unnatural Solidarity, they erect spoliation into a
system, they twist all our notions of justice, and they exalt that
individualist sentiment, which they were thought to have proscribed,
up to the highest point of power and perversity. Their
whole system is thus of a piece,—negation of the harmonies which
spring from liberty in the principle,—despotism and slavery in the
result,—immorality in the means.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Every effort to divert the natural course of responsibility is a
blow aimed at justice, at liberty, at order, at civilisation, and at
progress.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">At justice.</em> An act or a habit being assumed to exist, its good
or bad consequences must follow necessarily. Were it possible,
indeed, to suppress these consequences, there would doubtless be
some advantage in suspending the action of the natural law of
responsibility. But the only result to which a written law could
lead would be that the good effects of a bad action would be
reaped by the author of that action, and that its bad effects would
fall back on a third party, or upon the community; which has
certainly the special aspect of injustice.</p>

<p>Thus, modern societies are constituted on the principle that the
father of a family should rear and educate his children. And it
is this principle which restrains within just limits the increase
and distribution of population; each man acting under a sense of
responsibility. Men are not all indued with the same amount
of foresight; and<a
href="#FN_113" id="FNa_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> in large towns improvidence is allied with
immorality. We have nowadays a regular budget, and an administration,
for the purpose of collecting children abandoned by their
parents; no inquiry discourages this shameful desertion, and a
constantly increasing number of destitute children inundates our
poorer districts.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have a peasant who marries late in life, in order
not to be overburdened with a family, obliged to bring up the
children of others. He will not inculcate foresight on his son.
Another lives in continence, and we see him taxed to bring up a
set of bastards. In a religious point of view, his conscience is
tranquil, but in a human point of view he must call himself a
fool. . . . .&#160;.</p>

<p>We do not pretend here to enter on the grave question of public
<a id="p486" class="xxpn">[p486]</a> charity, we wish only to make this essential observation, that the
more a State is centralized, the more that it turns natural responsibility
into factitious solidarity, the more it takes away from consequences
(which thenceforth affect those who have no connexion
with their cause) their providential character of justice, chastisement,
and preventive restraint.</p>

<p>When Government cannot avoid charging itself with a service
which ought to remain within the domain of private activity, it
ought at least to allow the responsibility to rest as nearly as
possible where it would naturally fall. Thus, in the question
of foundling hospitals, the principle being that the father and
mother should bring up the child, the law should exhaust every
means of endeavouring to enforce this. Failing the parents, this
burden should fall on the commune; and failing the commune, on
the department. Do you desire to multiply foundlings <em class="e000I2">ad infinitum</em>?
Declare that the State will take charge of them. It
would be still worse if France should undertake to maintain the
children of the Chinese, and <em class="e000I2">vice versa</em>. . . . .&#160;.</p>

<p>It is, in truth, a singular thing that we should be always endeavouring
to make laws to check the evils of responsibility! Will it
never be understood that we do not annihilate these evils—we only
turn them into a new channel? The result is one injustice the
more, and one lesson the less. . . . .&#160;.</p>

<p>How is the world to be improved if it be not by every man
learning to discharge his duty better? And will each man not
discharge his duties better in proportion as he has more to suffer
by neglecting or violating them? If social action is to be mixed
up in the work of responsibility, it ought to be in order to second
it, not to thwart it, to concentrate its effects, not to abandon them
to chance.</p>

<p>It has been said that opinion is the mistress of the world.
Assuredly, in order that opinion should have its proper sway it
is necessary that it should be enlightened; and opinion is so much
more enlightened in proportion as each man who contributes to
form it perceives more clearly the connexion of causes and effects.
Now nothing leads us to perceive this connexion better than experience,
and experience, as we know, is personal, and the fruit of
responsibility.</p>

<p>In the natural play, then, of this great law of responsibility we
have a system of valuable teaching with which it is very imprudent
to tamper.</p>

<p>If, by ill-considered combinations, you relieve men from responsibility
for their actions, they may still be taught by theory—but
<a id="p487" class="xxpn">[p487]</a> no longer by experience. And I doubt if instruction which has
never been sanctioned and confirmed by experience is not more
dangerous than ignorance itself. . . . .&#160;.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">sense of responsibility</em> is eminently capable of improvement.</p>

<p>This is one of the most beautiful moral phenomena. There is
nothing which we admire more in a man, in a class, in a nation,
than the feeling of responsibility. It indicates superior moral culture,
and an exquisite sensibility to the awards of public opinion.
It may be, however, that the sense of responsibility is highly developed
in one thing and very little in another. In France,
among the educated classes, one would die of shame to be caught
cheating at play or addicting oneself to solitary drinking. These
things are laughed at among the peasants. But to traffic in
political rights, to make merchandise of his vote, to be guilty of
inconsistency, to cry out by turns <em class="e000I2">Vive le Roi! Vive la Ligue!</em> as
the interest of the moment may prompt, these are things which
our manners do not brand with shame.</p>

<p>The development of the sense of responsibility may be much
aided by female intervention. . . . .&#160;.</p>

<p>Females are themselves extremely sensible of the feeling of
responsibility. . . . .&#160;. It rests with them to create this
<em class="e000I2">force moralisatrice</em> among the other sex; for it is their province to
distribute praise and blame effectively. Why, then, do they not
do so? because they are not sufficiently acquainted with the connexion
between causes and effects in the moral world. . . . .&#160;.</p>

<p>The science of morals is the science of all, but especially of the
female sex, for they form the manners of a nation. . . . .&#160;. <a id="p488" class="xxpn">[p488]</a></p>

SOLIDARITY.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
If man were perfect, if he were infallible, society would present a
very different harmony from that which is the subject of our inquiries.
Ours is not the society of Fourier. It does not exclude
evil; it admits dissonances; only we assert that it does not cease
to be harmony if these dissonances pave the way to concord, and
bring us back to it.</p>

<p>Our point of departure is that man is fallible, and that God has
given him free will; and with the faculty of choosing, that of erring,
of mistaking what is false for what is true, of sacrificing the future
to the present, of giving way to unreasonable desires, etc.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>Man errs. But every act, every habit has its consequences.</p>

<p>By means of Responsibility, as we have seen, these consequences
fall back on the author of the act. A natural concatenation of rewards
or punishments, then, attracts him towards good, or repels
him from evil.</p>

<p>Had man been destined to a solitary life, and to solitary labour,
Responsibility would have been his only law.</p>

<p>But he is differently placed; he is sociable <em class="e000I2">by destination</em>. It is
not true, as Rousseau has said, that man is naturally a <em class="e000I2">perfect and
solitary whole</em>, and that the will of the lawgiver has transformed
him into a fraction of a greater <em class="e000I2">whole</em>. The family, the province,
the nation, the human race, are aggregates with which man has
<em class="e000I2">necessary</em> relations. Hence it follows that the actions and the
habits of the individual produce, besides the consequences which
fall back upon himself, other good or bad consequences which extend
themselves to his fellow-men. This is what we term the law
of <em class="e000I2">Solidarity</em>, which is a sort of <em class="e000I2">collective Responsibility</em>.</p>

<p>This idea of Rousseau that the legislator has invented society—an
idea false in itself—has been injurious in this respect, that it has
led men to think that Solidarity is of legislative creation, and we
<a id="p489" class="xxpn">[p489]</a> shall immediately see that modern legislators have based upon this
doctrine their efforts to subject society to an <em class="e000I2">artificial solidarity</em>,
acting in an inverse sense to <em class="e000I2">natural solidarity</em>. In everything,
the principle of these great manipulators of the human race is to
set up their own work in room of the work of God, which they
disown.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Our first task is to prove undeniably the natural existence of
the law of <em class="e000I2">Solidarity</em>.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century they did not believe in it. They adhered
to the doctrine of the personality of faults. The philosophers
of the last century, engaged above all in the reaction against
Catholicism, would have feared, by admitting the principle of
Solidarity, to open a door to the doctrine of <em class="e000I2">original sin</em>. Every
time Voltaire found in the Scriptures a man bearing the punishment
of another, he said ironically, “This is frightful, but the justice of
God is not that of man.”</p>

<p>We are not concerned here to discuss <em class="e000I2">original sin</em>. But what
Voltaire laughed at is nevertheless a fact, which is not less incontestable
than it is mysterious. The law of Solidarity makes its
appearance so frequently and so strikingly, in the individual and
in the masses, in details and in the aggregate, in particular and in
general facts, that to fail to recognise it implies either the blindness
of sectarianism or the zeal of embittered controversy.</p>

<p>The first rule of all human justice is to concentrate the punishment
of an action on its author, in virtue of the principle that
faults are personal. But this law, sacred as regards individuals,
is not the law of God, or even the law of society.</p>

<p>Why is this man rich? Because his father was active, honest,
industrious, and economical. The father practised virtue; the son
reaps the rewards.</p>

<p>Why is this other man always suffering, sick, feeble, timorous,
and wretched? Because his father, endowed with a powerful constitution,
abused it by debauchery and excess. To the guilty fall
the agreeable consequences of vice, to the innocent fall its fatal
consequences.</p>

<p>There exists not a man upon this earth whose condition has
not been determined by thousands of millions of facts in which
his own determinations have had no part. What I complain of
to-day was perhaps caused by the caprice of my great-grandfather,
etc.</p>

<p>Solidarity manifests itself on a greater scale still, and at
distances which are still more inexplicable, when we consider the
<a id="p490" class="xxpn">[p490]</a> relations of divers nations, or of different generations of the same
people.</p>

<p>Is it not strange that the eighteenth century was so occupied
with intellectual or material works of which we are now enjoying
the benefit? Is it not marvellous that we ourselves should make
such efforts to cover the country with railways, on which none of
us perhaps will ever travel? Who can fail to recognise the profound
influence of our old revolutions on the events of our own
time? Who can foresee what an inheritance of peace or of discord
our present discussions may bequeath to our children?</p>

<p>Look at the public loans. We make war,—we obey savage
passions,—we throw away by these means valuable power; and we
find means of laying the scourge of all this destruction on our
children, who may haply hold war in abhorrence, and be unable to
understand our passions and hatreds.</p>

<p>Cast your eyes upon Europe; contemplate the events which
agitate France, Germany, Italy, and Poland, and say if the law of
<em class="e000I2">Solidarity</em> is a chimerical law.</p>

<p>There is no need to carry this enumeration farther. In order to
prove undeniably the existence of the law, it is enough that the
action of one man, of one people, of one generation, exerts a
certain influence upon another man, another people, or another
generation. Society at large is only an aggregate of solidarities
which cross and overlap one another. This results from the communicable
nature of human intelligence. Conversation, literature,
discoveries, sciences, morals, etc., are all examples of this. All
these unperceived currents by which one mind corresponds with
another, all these efforts without visible connexion, the resulting
force of which nevertheless pushes on the human race towards an
equilibrium, towards an average level which is always rising—all
that vast treasury of utilities and of acquired knowledge which
each may draw upon without diminishing it, or augment without
being aware of it,—all this interchange of thoughts, of productions,
of services, and of labour, of good and evil, of virtue and vice,
which makes the human family one grand whole, and imparts to
thousands of millions of ephemeral existences a common, a universal,
a continuous life,—all this is <em class="e000I2">Solidarity</em>.</p>

<p>Naturally, then, and to a certain extent, there is an incontestable
Solidarity among men. In other words, Responsibility is not
exclusively personal, but is shared and divided. Action emanates
from individuality; consequences are spread over the community.</p>

<p>We must remark that it is in the nature of every man <em class="e000I2">to desire
<a id="p491" class="xxpn">[p491]</a> to be happy</em>. You may say that I am extolling egotism if you
will; I extol nothing; I show, I prove undeniably, the existence
of an innate universal sentiment, which can never cease to exist,—personal
interest, the desire for happiness, and the repugnance to
pain.</p>

<p>Hence it follows that the individual is led so to order his conduct
that the good consequences of his actions accrue to himself,
while the bad effects fall upon others. He endeavours to spread
these bad consequences over the greatest possible number of men,
in order that they may be less perceived, and call forth less reaction.</p>

<p>But opinion, <em class="e000I2">that mistress of the world</em>, the daughter of solidarity,
brings together all those scattered grievances, and collects
all aggrieved interests into a formidable resisting mass. When a
man’s habits become injurious to those who live around him, they
call forth a feeling of repulsion. We judge such habits severely.
We denounce them, we brand them; and the man who gives himself
up to them becomes an object of distrust, of contempt, and of
abhorrence. If he reap some advantages, they are soon far more
than compensated by the sufferings which public aversion accumulates
on his head. To the troublesome consequences which a bad
habit always entails in virtue of the law of <em class="e000I2">Responsibility</em>, there
come to be added other consequences still more grievous in virtue
of the law of <em class="e000I2">Solidarity</em>.</p>

<p>Our contempt for the man soon extends to the habit, to the
vice; and as the want of consideration is one of our most powerful
springs of action, it is clear that solidarity, by the reaction
which it brings to bear against vicious acts, tends to restrain and
to prevent them.</p>

<p>Solidarity, then, like Responsibility, is a <em class="e000I2">progressive force</em>; and
we see that, in relation to the author of the act, it resolves itself,
if I may so speak, into <em class="e000I2">repercussive or reflected responsibility</em>; that
it is still a system of reciprocal rewards and punishments, admirably
fitted to circumscribe evil, to extend good, and to urge on
mankind on the road of progress.</p>

<p>But in order that it should operate in this way,—in order that
those who benefit or suffer from an action which is not their own
should react upon its author by approbation or disapprobation,
by gratitude or resistance, by esteem, affection, praise, or blame,
hatred or vengeance,—one condition is indispensable; and that
condition is, that the connecting link between the act and all its
effects should be known and appreciated.</p>

<p>When the public is mistaken in this respect, the law fails in its
design. <a id="p492" class="xxpn">[p492]</a></p>

<p>An act is hurtful to the masses; but the masses are convinced
that this act is advantageous to them. What is the consequence?
The consequence is, that instead of reacting against it, in place of
condemning it, and by that means restraining it, the public exalt
it, honour it, extol it, and repeat it.</p>

<p>Nothing is more frequent, and here is the reason of it:</p>

<p>An act produces on the masses not only an effect, but a series
of effects. Now it frequently happens that the primary effect is
a local good, visible and tangible, whilst the ulterior effects set
a-filtering through the body politic evils which are difficult to discover
or to connect with their cause.</p>

<p>War is an example of this. In the infancy of society, we do
not perceive all the consequences of war. And, to say truth, in
a state of civilisation in which there is a less amount of anterior
labour (capital) exposed to destruction, less science and money
devoted to the machinery of war, etc., these consequences are less
prejudicial than they afterwards become. We see only the first
campaign, the booty which follows victory, the intoxication of
triumph. At that stage, war and warriors are very popular.
Then we see the enemy, having become conqueror in his turn,
burning down houses and harvests, levying contributions, and imposing
laws. In these alternations of success and misfortune, we
see generations of men annihilated, agriculture crushed, and two
nations impoverished. We see the most important portion of the
people contemning the arts of peace, turning their arms against
the institutions of their country, serving as the tools of despotism,
employing their restless energy in sedition and civil discord, and
creating barbarism and solitude at home, as they had formerly
done among their neighbours. Do we then pronounce war to be
plunder upon a great scale?&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. No; we see its effects
without desiring to understand its cause; and when this people, in
a state of decadence, shall be invaded in its turn by a swarm of
conquerors, centuries after the catastrophe, grave historians will
relate that the nation fell because the people had become enervated
by peace, because they had forgotten the art of war and the austere
virtues of their ancestors.</p>

<p>I could point out the same illusions in connexion with the
system of slavery.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>The same thing is true of religious errors.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>In our own day, the <em class="e000I2">régime</em> of prohibition gives rise to the same
fallacy.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>To bring back public opinion, by the diffusion of knowledge and
the profound appreciation of causes and effects, into that
<a id="p493" class="xxpn">[p493]</a> intelligent state in which bad tendencies come to be branded, and prejudicial
measures opposed, is to render a great service to one’s
country. When public opinion, deceived and misled, honours
what is worthy of contempt, contemns what is honourable,
punishes virtue and rewards vice, encourages what is hurtful and
discourages what is useful, applauds a lie and smothers truth under
indifference or insult, a nation turns its back upon progress, and
can only be reclaimed by terrible lessons and catastrophes.</p>

<p>We have indicated elsewhere the gross misuse which certain
Socialist schools have made of the word Solidarity.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>Let us now see in what spirit human laws should be framed.</p>

<p>It seems to me that here there can be no room for doubt.
Human law should coincide with the natural law. It should
facilitate and ensure the just retribution of men’s acts; in other
words, it should circumscribe solidarity, and organize reaction in
order to enforce responsibility. The law can have no other object
than to restrain vicious actions and to multiply virtuous ones, and
for that purpose it should favour the just distribution of rewards
and punishments, so that the bad effects of an act should be
concentrated as much as possible on the person who commits
it.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>In acting thus, the law conforms itself to the nature of things;
solidarity induces a reaction against a vicious act, and the law only
regulates that reaction.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>The law thus contributes to progress: The more rapidly it
brings back the bad effect of the act upon the agent, the more
surely it restrains the act itself.</p>

<p>To give an example: Violence is attended with pernicious consequences.
Among savages the repression of violence is left to
the natural course of things; and what happens? It provokes a
terrible reaction. When a man has committed an act of violence
against another man, an inextinguishable desire of vengeance is
lighted up in the family of the injured party, and is transmitted
from generation to generation. The law interferes; and what
ought it to do? Should it limit itself to stifle the desire for vengeance,
to repress it, to punish it? It is clear that this would be
to encourage violence, by sheltering it from reprisals. This is not,
then, what the law should do. It ought to substitute itself, so to
speak, for the spirit of vengeance, by organizing in its place a reaction
against the violence. It should say to the injured family,
“I charge myself with the repression of the act you complain of.”
When the whole tribe considers itself as injured and menaced, the
<a id="p494" class="xxpn">[p494]</a> law inquires into the grievance, interrogates the guilty party,
makes sure that there is no error as to the fact and as to the
person, and thus represses with regularity and certainty an act
which would have been punished irregularly.<a

SOCIAL MOTIVE FORCE.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
It belongs to no human science to assign the ultimate reason of
things.</p>

<p>Man suffers; society suffers. We ask why? This is to ask
why God has been pleased to indue man with sensibility and free
will. As regards this, no one knows more than the revelation in
which he has faith has taught him.</p>

<p>But whatever may have been the designs of God, what human
science can take as its point of departure is a positive fact,
namely, that man has been created <em class="e000I2">free</em> and indued with <em class="e000I2">feeling</em>.</p>

<p>This is so true that I defy those who are astonished at it to conceive
a living, thinking, acting being indued with volition and
affections—such a being, in short, as man—yet destitute of sensibility
and free will.</p>

<p>Could God have ordered things otherwise? Reason undoubtedly
answers <em class="e000I2">yes</em>, but imagination says eternally <em class="e000I2">no</em>, so
radically impossible is it for us to separate in thought humanity
from this double attribute. Now, to be indued with <em class="e000I2">feeling</em> is to
be capable of experiencing sensations which are agreeable or
painful. Hence comfort or uneasiness. From the moment,
then, that God gave existence to sensibility, He permitted evil, or
the possibility of evil.</p>

<p>In giving us free will, He has indued us with the faculty, at
least in a certain measure, of shunning evil and seeking after
good. Free will supposes and accompanies intelligence—what
would the faculty of choosing signify if it were not allied with the
faculty of examining, of comparing, of judging? Thus, every
man who comes into the world brings with him <em class="e000I2">mind</em> and a
<em class="e000I2">motive force</em>.</p>

<p>The motive force is that personal irresistible impulse, the
essence of all our forces, which leads us to shun Evil and seek
<a id="p496" class="xxpn">[p496]</a> after Good. We term it the instinct of preservation, personal or
private interest.</p>

<p>This sentiment has been sometimes decried, sometimes misunderstood,
but as regards its existence there can be no doubt.
Irresistibly we seek after all which, according to our notions, can
ameliorate our destiny, and we avoid all which is likely to
deteriorate it. This is at least as certain as it is that every
material molecule possesses centripetal and centrifugal force.
And just as the double movement of attraction and repulsion is
the grand spring of the physical world, we may affirm that the
double force of human attraction towards happiness and human
repulsion from pain is the mainspring of the social mechanism.</p>

<p>But it is not enough that man is irresistibly led to prefer good
to evil; he must also be able to discern what is good and what is
evil. This is what God has provided for in giving him that marvellous
and complex mechanism called intelligence. To fix his
attention, to compare, judge, reason, connect effects with causes,
to remember, to foresee; such are—if I may use the expression—the
wheels of that admirable machine.</p>

<p>The impulsive force which is possessed by each of us moves
under the direction of our intelligence. But our intelligence is
imperfect. It is liable to error. We compare, we judge, we act in
consequence; but we may err, we may make a bad choice, we may
tend towards evil, mistaking it for good, or we may shun good,
mistaking it for evil. This is the first source of social <em class="e000I2">dissonances</em>;
and it is inevitable, for this reason, that the great motive spring of
humanity—personal interest—is not, like material attraction, a
blind force, but a force guided by an imperfect intelligence. Let
us be very sure, then, that we shall not see Harmony except under
this restriction. God has not seen proper to found social order or
Harmony upon perfection, but upon human perfectibility, our
capacity for improvement. If our intelligence is imperfect, it is
improvable. It develops, enlarges, and rectifies itself. It begins
of new and verifies its operations. Experience at each moment
puts us right, and Responsibility suspends over our heads a complete
system of punishments and rewards. Every step that we
take on the road of error plunges us into increased suffering, and
in such a way that the warning cannot fail to be heard, and the
rectification of our determinations, and consequently of our actions,
follows, sooner or later, with infallible certainty.</p>

<p>Under the impulse which urges him on, ardent to pursue happiness,
prompt to seize it, man may be seeking his own good in the
misery of others. This is a second and an abundant source of
<a id="p497" class="xxpn">[p497]</a> discordant social combinations. But the limit of such disturbances is
marked; and they find their inevitable doom in the law of Solidarity.
Individual force thus misapplied calls forth opposition
from all the analogous forces, which, antagonistic to evil by their
nature, repel injustice and chastise it.</p>

<p>It is thus that progress is realized, and it is not the less progress
from being dearly bought. It springs from a native impulse, which
is universal and inherent in our nature, directed by an intelligence
which is frequently misled, and subjected to a will which is frequently
depraved. Arrested on its march by Error and Injustice,
it receives the all-powerful assistance of Responsibility and Solidarity
to enable it to surmount these obstacles, and it cannot fail
to receive that assistance since it springs from these obstacles
themselves.</p>

<p>This internal, universal, and imperishable motive power, which
resides in each individual and constitutes him an active being, this
tendency of every man to pursue happiness and shun misery, this
product, this effect, this necessary complement of sensibility, without
which sensibility would be only an inexplicable scourge, this
primordial phenomenon which is at the bottom of all human
actions, this attractive and repulsive force which we have denominated
the mainspring of the social mechanism, has had for
detractors the greater part of our publicists; and this is one of the
strangest aberrations which the annals of science present.</p>

<p>It is true that self-interest is the cause of all the evils, as it
is of all the good, incident to man. It cannot fail to be so,
since it determines all our acts. Seeing this, some publicists
can imagine no better means of eradicating evil than by stifling
<em class="e000I2">self-interest</em>. But as by this means they would destroy the very
spring and motive of our activity, they have thought proper to
endow us with a different motive force, namely, <em class="e000I2">devotion</em>, <em class="e000I2">self-sacrifice</em>.
They hope that henceforth all transactions and social
combinations will take place at their bidding, upon the principle
of self-abandonment. We are no longer to pursue our own
happiness, but the happiness of others; the warnings of sensibility
are to go for nothing, like the rewards and punishments
of Responsibility. All the laws of our nature are to be reversed;
the spirit of sacrifice is to be substituted for the instinct of
preservation; in a word, no one is to think longer on his own
personality, but for the purpose of hastening to sacrifice it to
the public good. It is from such a universal transformation of
the human heart that certain publicists, who think themselves
very religious, expect to realize perfect social harmony. They
<a id="p498" class="xxpn">[p498]</a> have forgotten to tell us how they hope to effect this indispensable
preliminary, the transformation of the human heart.</p>

<p>If they are foolish enough to undertake this, they will find that
they want the power to accomplish it. Do they desire the proof
of what I say? Let them try the experiment on themselves;
let them endeavour to stifle in their own hearts all feeling of
self-interest, so that it shall no longer make its appearance in
the most ordinary actions of life. They will not be long in finding
out their powerlessness. Why, then, pretend to impose upon
all men, without exception, a doctrine to which they themselves
cannot submit?</p>

<p>I confess myself unable to see anything religious, unless it be
in intention and appearance, in these affected theories, in these
impracticable maxims which they affect so earnestly to preach,
while they continue to act just as the vulgar act. Is it, I would
ask, true and genuine religion which inspires these catholic economists
with the presumptuous thought that God has done His work
ill, and that it is their mission to repair it? Bossuet did not
think so when he said, “Man aspires to happiness, and he cannot
help aspiring to it.”</p>

<p>Declamations against personal interest never can have much
scientific significance; for self-interest is part of man’s indestructible
nature—at least, we cannot destroy it without destroying
man himself. All that religion, morals, and political
economy can do is to give an enlightened direction to this impulsive
force—to point out not only the primary, but the ulterior
consequences of those acts to which it urges us. A superior and
progressive satisfaction consequent on a transient suffering, long
continued and constantly increased suffering following on a
momentary gratification; such, after all, are moral good and evil.
That which determines the choice of men towards virtue is an
elevated and enlightened interest, but it is always primarily a
personal interest.</p>

<p>If it is strange that personal interest should be decried, when
considered not with reference to its immoral abuse, but as the
providential moving spring of all human activity, it is still
stranger that it should have been put aside altogether, and that
men should have imagined themselves in a situation to frame a
system of social science without taking it into account.</p>

<p>It is an inexplicable instance of folly that publicists in general
should regard themselves as the depositaries and the arbiters of
this motive spring. Each starts from this point of departure:
Assuming that mankind are a flock, and that I am the shepherd,
<a id="p499" class="xxpn">[p499]</a> how am I to manage in order to make mankind happy? Or this:
Given on the one hand a certain quantity of clay, and on the other
a potter, what should the potter do in order to turn that clay to
the best account?</p>

<p>Our publicists may differ when the question comes to be which
is the best potter, who forms and moulds the clay most advantageously;
but they are all at one upon this, that their function is
to knead the human clay, and what the clay has to do is simply
to be kneaded by them. Under the title of legislators they establish
between themselves and the human race relations analogous to
those of guardian and ward. The idea never occurs to them that
the human race is a living sentient body, indued with volition, and
acting according to laws which it is not their business to invent,
since they already exist, nor to impose, but to study; that humanity
is an aggregate of beings in all respects like themselves, and in no
way inferior or subordinate; endowed both with an impulse to
act, and with intelligence to choose; which feels on all sides the
stimulus of Responsibility and Solidarity; and that, in short, from
all these phenomena there results an aggregate of self-existing
relations, which it is not the business of science to create, as they
imagine, but to observe.</p>

<p>Rousseau, I think, is the publicist who has most naïvely exhumed
from antiquity this omnipotence of the resuscitated legislator of
the Greeks. Convinced that the social order is a human invention,
he compares it to a machine; men are the wheels of that machine,
the ruler sets it in motion; the lawgiver invents it, under the
impulse given him by the publicist, who thus finds himself definitively
the mainspring and regulator of the human species. This
is the reason why the publicist never fails to address himself to
the legislator in the imperative style; he decrees him to decree:
“Found your society upon such or such a principle; give it good
manners and customs; bend it to the yoke of religion; direct its
aims and energies towards arms, or commerce, or agriculture, or
virtue,” etc. Others more modest speak in this way: “Idlers will
not be tolerated in the republic; you will distribute the population
conveniently between the towns and the country; you will take
order that there shall be neither rich nor poor,” etc.</p>

<p>These formulas attest the unmeasured presumption of those who
employ them. They imply a doctrine which does not leave one
atom of dignity to the human race.</p>

<p>I know not whether they are more false in theory or pernicious
in practice. In both views, they lead to deplorable results.</p>

<p>They would lead us to believe that the social economy is an
<a id="p500" class="xxpn">[p500]</a> artificial arrangement coined in the brain of an inventor. Hence
every publicist constitutes himself an inventor. His greatest
desire is to find acceptance for his mechanism; his greatest care
is to create abhorrence of all others, and principally of that which
springs spontaneously from the organization of man and from the
nature of things. The books conceived and written on this plan
are, and can only be, prolix declamations against Society.</p>

<p>This false science does not study the concatenation of effects
and causes. It does not inquire into the good and evil produced
by men’s actions, and trust afterwards to the motive force of
Society in choosing the road it is to follow. No; it enjoins, it
constrains, it imposes, or, if it cannot do that, it counsels; like a
natural philosopher who should say to the stone, “Thou art not
supported; I order thee to fall, or at least I advise it.” It is
upon this footing that M. Droz has said that “the design of
political economy is to render easy circumstances as general as
possible,”—a definition which has been welcomed with great
favour by the Socialists, because it opens a door to every Utopia,
and leads to artificial regulation. What should we say if M.
Arago were to open his course in this way, “The object of astronomy
is to render gravitation as general as possible?” It is true
that men are animated beings, indued with volition, and acting
under the influence of free will. But there also resides in them
an internal force, a sort of gravitation; and the question is to
know towards what they gravitate. If it be fatally, inevitably,
towards evil, there is no remedy, and assuredly the remedy will
not come to us from a publicist subject like other men to the
common tendency. If it be towards good, here we have the
motive force already found; science has no need to substitute for
it constraint or advice. Its part is to enlighten our free will, to
display effects as flowing from causes, well assured that, under the
influence of truth, “ease and material prosperity tend to become
as general as possible.”</p>

<p>Practically, the doctrine which would place the motive force of
society, not in mankind at large, nor in their peculiar organization,
but in legislators and governments, is attended with consequences
still more deplorable. It tends to draw down upon Governments
a crushing responsibility, from which they never recover. If there
are sufferings, it is the fault of Government; if there are poor, it is
the fault of Government. Is not Government the prime mover?
If the mainspring is bad or inoperative, break it, and choose
another. Or else they lay the blame on science itself; and in our
days we have it repeated <em class="e000I2">ad nauseam</em> that “all social sufferings are
<a id="p501" class="xxpn">[p501]</a> imputable to Political Economy.”<a
href="#FN_115" id="FNa_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> Why not, when Political
Economy presents herself as having for design to realize the
happiness of men without their co-operation? When such notions
prevail, the last thing men take it into their heads to do is to
turn their regards upon themselves, and inquire whether the true
cause of their sufferings is not their own ignorance and injustice;
their ignorance which brings them under the discipline of Responsibility,
and their injustice which draws down upon them the
reaction of Solidarity. How should mankind ever dream of seeking
in their errors the cause of their sufferings when the human
race is persuaded that it is inert by nature, and that the principle
of all activity, consequently of all responsibility, is external,
and resides in the will of the lawgiver and the governing
power?</p>

<p>Were I called upon to mark the feature which distinguishes
Socialism from Political Economy, I should find it here. Socialism
boasts of a vast number of sects. Each sect has its Utopia, and
so far are they from any mutual understanding, that they declare
against each other war to the knife. The <em class="e000I2">atelier social organisé</em> of
M. Blanc, and the <em class="e000I2">an-archie</em> of M. Proudhon,—the <em class="e000I2">association</em> of
Fourier, and the <em class="e000I2">communisme</em> of M. Cabet,—are as different from
each other as night is from day. Why do these sectarian leaders,
then, range themselves under the common denomination of <em class="e000I2">Socialists</em>,
and what is the bond which unites them against natural or providential
society? They have no other bond than this, <em class="e000I2">they all repudiate
natural society</em>. What they wish is an artificial society springing
ready made from the brain of the inventor. No doubt, each of
them wishes to be the Jupiter of this Minerva—no doubt each of
them hugs his own contrivance, and dreams of his own social order.
But they have this in common, that they recognise in humanity
neither the motive force, which urges mankind on to good, nor the
<em class="e000I2">curative</em> force, which delivers them from evil. They fight among
themselves as to what form they are to mould the human clay
into, but they are all agreed that humanity is clay to be moulded.
Humanity is not in their eyes a living harmonious being, that God
himself has provided with progressive and self-sustaining forces,
but rather a mass of inert matter which has been waiting for them
to impart to it sentiment and life; it is not a subject to be studied,
but a subject to be experimented on.</p>

<p>Political Economy, on the other hand, after having clearly shown
<a id="p502" class="xxpn">[p502]</a> that there are in each man forces of impulse and repulsion, the
aggregate of which constitutes the social impellent, and after
being convinced that this motive force tends towards good, never
dreams of annihilating it in order to substitute another of its own
creation, but studies the varied and complicated social phenomena
to which it gives birth.</p>

<p>Is this to say that Political Economy is as much a stranger to
social progress, as astronomy is to the motion of the heavenly
bodies? Certainly not. Political Economy has to do with beings
which are intelligent and free,—and, as such, let us never forget,
subject to error. Their tendency is towards good; but they may
err. Science, then, interferes usefully, not to create causes and
effects, not to change the tendencies of man, not to subject him
to organizations, to injunctions, or even to advice, but to point
out to him the good and the evil which result from his determinations.</p>

<p>Political Economy is thus quite a science of observation and
exposition. She does not say to men, “I enjoin you, I counsel
you, not to go too near the fire;” she does not say, “I have
invented a social organization; the gods have taught me institutions
which will keep you at a respectful distance from the fire.”
No, Political Economy only shows men clearly that fire will burn
them, proclaims it, proves it, and does the same thing as regards
all other social or moral phenomena, convinced that this is enough.
The repugnance to die by fire is considered as a primordial pre-existent
fact, which Political Economy has not created, and which
she cannot alter or change.</p>

<p>Economists cannot be always at one; but it is easy to see that
their differences are quite of another kind from those which divide
the Socialists. Two men who devote their whole attention to
observe one and the same phenomenon and its effects—rent, for
example, exchange, competition—may not arrive at the same
conclusion, and this proves nothing more than that one of the
two has observed the phenomenon inaccurately or imperfectly.
It is an operation to be repeated. With the aid of other observers,
the probability is that truth in the end will be discovered.
It is for this reason, that if each economist were, like
each astronomer, to make himself fully acquainted with what
his predecessors have done, as far as they have gone, the science
would be progressive, and for that reason more and more useful,
rectifying constantly observations inaccurately made, and adding
indefinitely new observations to those which had been made before.</p>

<p>But the Socialists,—each pursuing his own road, and coining
<a id="p503" class="xxpn">[p503]</a> artificial combinations in the mint of his own brain,—may pursue
their inquiries in this way to all eternity without coming to any
common understanding, and without the labours of one aiding to
any extent the labours of another. Say profited by the labours
of Adam Smith; Rossi by those of Say; Blanqui and Joseph
Garnier by those of all their predecessors. But Plato, Sir
Thomas More, Harrington, Fénélon, Fourier, might amuse themselves
with organizing according to their own fancy a Republic,
an Utopia, an Oceana, a Salente, a Phalanstère, and no one would
ever discover the slightest affinity between their chimerical creations.
These dreamers spin all out of their own imaginations,
men as well as things. They invent a social order without respect
to the human heart, and then they invent a human heart to suit
their social order. . . . . . . . .

<h2 title="XXIII. Existence of Evil"><a id="XXIII"></a>XXIII.<br />
EXISTENCE OF EVIL.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
In these last days science has retrograded and been driven back.
It has been bent and twisted under the obligation imposed upon it,
if I may so speak, of denying the existence of Evil under pain of
being convicted of denying the existence of God.</p>

<p>Writers whose business it is to display exquisite sensibility, unbounded
philanthropy, and unrivalled devotion to religion, have got
into the way of saying, “Evil cannot enter into the providential
plan. Suffering is no ordinance of God and nature, but comes
from human institutions.”</p>

<p>As this doctrine falls in with the passions that they desire to
cherish, it soon becomes popular. Books and journals have been
filled with declamations against society. Science is no longer
permitted to study facts impartially. Whoever dares to warn
men that a certain vice, a certain habit, leads necessarily to
certain hurtful consequences, is marked down as a man destitute
of human feelings, without religion, an Atheist, a Malthusian, an
Economist.</p>

<p>Socialism has carried its folly so far as to announce the termination
of all social suffering, but not of all individual suffering. It
has not ventured to predict that a day will come when man will
no longer suffer, grow old, and die.</p>

<p>Now, I would ask, is it easier to reconcile with the infinite
goodness of God, evil which assails individually every man who
comes into the world, than evil which is extended over society at
large? And then is it not a contradiction so transparent as to be
puerile, to deny the existence of suffering in the masses, when we
admit its existence in individuals?</p>

<p>Man suffers, and will always suffer. Society, then, also
suffers, and will always suffer. Those who address mankind
should have the courage to tell them this. Humanity is not
<a id="p505" class="xxpn">[p505]</a> a fine lady with delicate nerves and an irritable temperament,
from whom we must conceal the coming storm, more especially
when to foresee it is the only way to ensure our getting out of it
safely. In this respect, all the books with which France has
been inundated, from Sismondi and Buret downwards, appear to
me to be wanting in virility. Their authors dare not tell the
truth; nay, they dare not investigate it, for fear of discovering
that absolute poverty is the necessary starting-point of the human
race, and that, consequently, so far are we from being in a
position to attribute that poverty to the social order, it is to the
social order that we must attribute all the triumphs which we have
already achieved over our original destitution. But, then, after
such an avowal, they could no longer constitute themselves
tribunes of the people, and the avengers of the masses oppressed
by civilisation.</p>

<p>After all, science merely establishes, combines, and deduces
facts; she does not create them; she does not produce them, nor
is she responsible for them. Is it not strange that men should
have gone the length of announcing and disseminating the paradox,
that if mankind suffer, their sufferings are due to Political
Economy? Thus, after being blamed for investigating the sufferings
of society, Political Economy is accused of engendering those
sufferings by that same investigation.</p>

<p>I assert that science can do nothing more than observe and
establish facts. Prove to us that humanity, instead of being progressive,
is retrograde; and that inevitable and insurmountable
laws urge mankind on to irremediable deterioration. Show us
that the law of Malthus and that of Ricardo are true in their
worst and most pernicious sense, and that it is impossible to deny
the tyranny of capital, or the incompatibility between machinery
and labour, or any of the other contradictory alternatives in which
Châteaubriand and Tocqueville have placed the human race; then
I maintain that science ought to proclaim this, and proclaim it
aloud.</p>

<p>Why should we shut our eyes to a gulf which is gaping before
us? Do we require the naturalist or the physiologist to reason
upon individual man, on the assumption that his organs are exempt
from pain or not liable to destruction? <em class="e000I2">Pulvis es, et in pulverem
reverteris</em>; such is the declaration of anatomical science backed by
universal experience. No doubt, this is a hard truth for us to
receive—not less hard than the contested propositions of Malthus
and Ricardo. But are we for this reason to spare the delicate
sensibility which has sprung up all at once among our modern
<a id="p506" class="xxpn">[p506]</a> publicists, and has given existence to Socialism? Is medical
science, for the same reason, to affirm audaciously that we are
constantly renewing our youth and are immortal? Or, if medical
science refuse to stoop to such juggling, are we to foam at the
mouth, and cry out, as has been done in the case of the social
sciences—“Medical science admits the existence of pain and
death; it is misanthropical; it is cruel; it accuses God of being
malevolent or powerless; it is impious; it is atheistical; nay,
more, it creates the evil the existence of which it refuses to
deny”?</p>

<p>I have never doubted that the Socialist schools have led away
many generous hearts and earnest minds, and I have no wish to
humiliate any one. But the general character of Socialism is very
whimsical, and I cannot help asking myself how long such a
tissue of puerilities can continue in vogue.</p>

<p>In Socialism all is affectation.</p>

<p>It affects scientific forms and scientific language, and we have
seen what sort of science it teaches.</p>

<p>In its writings, it affects a delicacy of nerve so feminine as to be
unable to listen to a tale of social sufferings; and whilst it has
introduced into literature this insipid and mawkish sensibility, it
has established in the arts a taste for the trivial and the horrible;
in ordinary life, a sort of scarecrow fashion in dress, appearance,
and deportment—the long beard, the grim and sullen countenance,
the vulgar airs of a village Titan or Prometheus. In politics
(where such puerilities are less innocent), Socialism has introduced
the doctrine of energetic means of <em class="e000I2">transition</em>, the violence of
revolutionary practices, life and material interests sacrificed <em class="e000I2">en masse</em>
to what is ideal and chimerical. But what Socialism affects, above
all, is a certain show and appearance of religion? This is only
one of the Socialist tactics, it is true—such tactics are always
disgraceful to a school when they lead to hypocrisy.</p>

<p>These Socialists are perpetually talking to us of Christ;
but I would ask them, how it is that while they acknowledge
that Christ, the innocent <em class="e000I2">par excellence</em>, prayed in His agony
that “the cup might pass from Him,” adding, “Nevertheless,
not my will but Thine be done,” they should think it strange
that mankind at large should be called upon to exercise resignation
also.</p>

<p>No doubt, had God willed it, He might have so arranged His
almighty plans that just as the individual advances towards inevitable
death, the human race might have advanced towards inevitable
destruction. In that case, we should have had no choice but to
<a id="p507" class="xxpn">[p507]</a> submit, and science, whether she liked it or not, must have
admitted the sombre social <em class="e000I2">dénoûment</em>, just as she now admits the
melancholy individual <em class="e000I2">dénoûment</em>.</p>

<p>But happily it is not so.</p>

<p>There is redemption for man, and for humanity.</p>

<p>The one is indued with an immortal soul; the other with indefinite
perfectibility. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

<h2 title="XXIV. Perfectibility"><a id="XXIV"></a>XXIV.<br />
PERFECTIBILITY.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
That the human race is perfectible; that it progresses towards a
higher and higher level; that its wealth is increasing and becoming
more equalized; that its ideas are being enlarged and purified;
that its errors, and the oppressions which these errors support, are
disappearing; that its knowledge shines with brighter and brighter
effulgence; that its morality is improving; that it is learning, by
reason or by experience, in the domain of responsibility, the art of
earning a constantly larger amount of recompense, and a constantly
smaller amount of chastisement; that, consequently, evil is
continually lessening, and good continually increasing;—these are
conclusions which it is impossible to doubt when we scrutinize
the nature of man and that intelligent principle, which is his
essence, which was breathed into him with the breath of life, and
warrants the scriptural declaration that man is made in the image
of God.</p>

<p>We know too well that man is not a perfect being. Were he
perfect, he would not reflect a vague resemblance of God; he would
be God himself. He is imperfect, then,—subject to error and to
suffering,—but, on the other hand, were he stationary, what title
could he have to claim the unspeakable privilege of bearing in himself
the image of a perfect being?</p>

<p>Moreover, if intelligence, which is the faculty of comparing, of
judging, of rectifying errors, of learning, does not constitute individual
perfectibility, what can constitute it?</p>

<p>And if the union of all individual perfectibilities, especially
among beings capable of communicating to each other their
acquisitions, does not afford a guarantee for collective perfectibility,
we must renounce all philosophy and all moral and political
science.</p>

<p>What constitutes man’s perfectibility is his intelligence, or the
<a id="p509" class="xxpn">[p509]</a> faculty which has been given to him of passing from error, which
is the parent of evil, to truth, which is the generating principle of
good.</p>

<p>It is science and experience which cause man to abandon, in his
mind, error for truth, and afterwards, in his conduct, evil for good;
it is the discovery which he makes, in phenomena and in acts, of
effects which he had not suspected.</p>

<p>But to enable him to acquire this science, he must have an
interest in acquiring it. In order that he should profit by this
experience, he must have an interest in profiting by it. It is in
the law of responsibility, then, that we must search for the means
of realizing human perfectibility.</p>

<p>And as we can form no idea of responsibility apart from liberty;
as acts which are not voluntary can afford neither instruction nor
available experience; as beings capable of being improved or deteriorated
by the exclusive action of external causes without the participation
of choice, reflection, or free will (although this happens
in the case of unconscious organized matter), could not be called
perfectible, in the moral acceptation of the word, we must conclude
that liberty is the very essence of progress. To impair man’s
liberty is not only to hurt and degrade him; it is to change his
nature; it is (in the measure and proportion in which such oppression
is exercised) to render him incapable of improvement; it is
to despoil him of his resemblance to the Creator; it is to dim and
deaden in his noble nature that vital spark which glowed there
from the beginning.</p>

<p>But in thus proclaiming aloud our fixed and unalterable belief in
human perfectibility, and in progress, which is necessary in every
sense, and which, by a marvellous correspondence, is as much more
active in one direction as it is more active in all others, we must
not be regarded as indulging in Utopianism, or be considered as
optimists, believing “all to be for the best, in the best of worlds,”
and expecting the immediate arrival of the millennium.</p>

<p>Alas! when we turn our regards on the world as it is, and see
around us the enormous amount of mud and meanness, suffering
and complaint, vice and crime, which still exist,—when we reflect
on the moral action exerted on society by the classes who ought to
point out to the lagging multitude the way to the New Jerusalem,—when
we ask ourselves what use the rich make of their fortune,
the poets of their genius, philosophers of their scientific lucubrations,
journalists of the ministry with which they are invested, high
functionaries, ministers of state, representatives of the people,
kings, of the power which fate has placed in their hands,—when
<a id="p510" class="xxpn">[p510]</a> we witness revolutions like that which has recently agitated
Europe, and in which each man seems to be in search of what
must in the long-run prove fatal to himself and to society at large,—when
we see cupidity in all shapes and among all ranks, the
constant sacrifice of the interests of others to our own selfish
interest, and of the future to the present,—when we see that great
and inevitable moving spring of the human race, personal interest,
still making its appearance only in manifestations the most material
and the most improvident,—when we see the working classes,
preyed upon by the parasitism of public functionaries, rise up in
revolutionary convulsions, not against this withering parasitism,
but against wealth legitimately acquired, that is to say, against
the very element of their own deliverance and the principle of their
own right and force,—when such spectacles present themselves to
us on all sides, we get afraid of ourselves, we tremble for our faith in
human perfectibility, the light would seem to waver, and be on the
eve of extinction, leaving us in the fearful darkness of Pessimism.</p>

<p>But no—there is no ground for despair. Whatever be the
impressions which too recent circumstances have made upon us,
humanity still moves onward. What causes the illusion is that
we measure the life of nations by the short span of our own individual
lives; and because a few years are a long period for us, we
imagine them also a long period for them. But even adopting this
inadequate measure, the progress of society on all sides is visible.
I need scarcely remind you of the marvels which have already been
accomplished in what concerns material advantages, the improved
salubrity of towns, and in the means of locomotion and communication,
etc.</p>

<p>In a political point of view, has the French nation gained no
experience? Who dares affirm that had all the difficulties through
which we have just passed presented themselves half a century ago,
or sooner, France would have overcome them with as much ability,
prudence, and wisdom, and with so few sacrifices? I write these
lines in a country which has been fertile in revolutions. Florence
used to have a rising every five years, and at each rising one-half of
her citizens robbed and murdered the other half. Had we only a
little more imagination—not that which creates, invents, and assumes
facts, but that which recalls them and brings them to mind—we
should be more just to our times and to our contemporaries!
What remains true, and it is a truth which no one can know better
than an Economist, is this, that human progress, especially in its
dawn, is excessively slow, so very slow as to give rise to despair
in the heart of the philanthropist.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. <a id="p511" class="xxpn">[p511]</a></p>

<p>Men whose genius invests them with the power of the press
ought, it seems to me, to regard things more nearly, before scattering
amidst the social fermentation discouraging speculations which
imply for humanity the alternative of two modes of degradation.</p>

<p>We have already seen some examples of this, when treating of
population, of rent, of machinery, of the division of inheritance,
etc.</p>

<p>Here is another, taken from M. de Châteaubriand, who merely
formulates a fashionable conventionalism: “The corruption of
morals and the civilisation of nations march abreast. If the last
present means of liberty, the first is an inexhaustible source of
slavery.”</p>

<p>It is beyond doubt that civilisation presents means of liberty,
and it is equally beyond doubt that corruption is a source of
slavery. That which is doubtful, more than doubtful,—and what
for my own part I deny solemnly and formally,—is this, that
civilisation and corruption march abreast. If it were so, a fatal
equilibrium would be established between <em class="e000I2">the means of liberty</em> and
<em class="e000I2">the sources of slavery</em>; and immobility would be the fate of the
human race.</p>

<p>There cannot, moreover, enter into the human heart a thought
more melancholy, more discouraging, more desolating, a thought
more fitted to urge us to despair, to irreligion, to impiety, to blasphemy,
than this, that every human being, whether he wills it or
not, whether he doubts it or not, proceeds on the road of civilisation—and
civilisation is corruption!</p>

<p>Then, if all civilisation be corruption, wherein consist its advantages?
It is impossible to pretend that civilisation is unattended
with moral, intellectual, and material advantages, for then it
would cease to be civilisation. As Châteaubriand employs the
term, civilisation signifies material progress, an increase of population,
of wealth, of prosperity, the development of intelligence,
the advancement of the sciences; and all these steps of progress
imply, according to him, a corresponding retrogression of the
moral sense.</p>

<p>This were enough to tempt men to a wholesale suicide; for I
repeat that material and intellectual progress is not of our preparation
and ordination. God himself has decreed it, in giving us
expansible desires and improvable faculties. We are urged on to
it without wishing it, without knowing it,—Châteaubriand, and his
equals, if he has any, more than any one else. And this progress
is to sink us deeper and deeper into immorality and slavery, by
means of corruption.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.
<a id="p512" class="xxpn">[p512]</a></p>

<p>I thought at first that Châteaubriand had let slip an unguarded
phrase, as poets frequently do, without examining it too narrowly.
With that class of writers, sound sometimes runs away with sense.
Provided the antithesis is symmetrical, what matters it that the
thought be false or objectionable? Provided the metaphor produces
its intended effect, that it has an air of inspiration and
depth, that it secures the applause of the public, and enables the
author to pass for an oracle, of what importance are exactitude
and truth?</p>

<p>I had thought, then, that Châteaubriand, giving way to a momentary
excess of misanthropy, had allowed himself to formulate
a conventionalism, a vulgarism dragged from the kennel. “Civilisation
and corruption march abreast,” is a phrase that has been
repeated since the days of Heraclitus, but it is not more true on
that account.</p>

<p>At a distance of several years, however, the same great writer
has reproduced the same thought, and in a more didactic form;
which shows that it expressed his deliberate opinion. It is proper
to combat it, not because it comes from Châteaubriand, but because
it has got abroad, and so generally prevails.</p>

<p>“The material condition is ameliorated,” he says, “intellectual
progress advances, and nations, in place of profiting, decay. Here
is the explanation of the decay of society and the growth of the
individual. Had the moral sense been developed in proportion to
the development of intelligence, there would have been a counter
weight, and the human race would have grown greater without
danger. But it is just the contrary which happens. The perception
of good and evil is obscured in proportion as intelligence
is enlightened; conscience becomes narrowed in proportion as
ideas are enlarged.”—<em class="e000I2">Mémoires d’Outre-Tombe</em>,

WITH POLITICS, WITH LEGISLATION.<a href="#FN_116" id="FNa_116"

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="tocpointer"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></div>

<p class="chapterhead">
A phenomenon is always found placed between two other phenomena,
one of which is its <em class="e000I2">efficient</em>, and the other its <em class="e000I2">final</em> cause;
<a id="p514" class="xxpn">[p514]</a> and science has not done with that phenomenon as long as either
of these relations remains undeveloped.</p>

<p>The human mind generally begins, I think, with the discovery
of final causes, because they are more immediately interesting to
us. No species of knowledge, besides, leads us with more force
towards religious ideas, or is more fitted to make us feel in all the
fibres of our heart a lively sense of gratitude for the inexhaustible
goodness of God.</p>

<p>Habit, it is true, has so familiarized us with a great number of
these <em class="e000I2">providential intentions</em>, that we enjoy them without thought.
We see, and we hear, without thinking of the ingenious mechanism
of the eye and of the ear. The sun, the dew, the rain, lavish upon
us their useful effects, or their gentle sensations, without awakening
our surprise or our gratitude. This is solely owing to the
continued action upon us of these admirable phenomena. For
let a final cause, although comparatively insignificant, come to
be disclosed to us for the first time, let the botanist explain to
us why this plant affects such or such a form, or why that other
is clothed in such or such a colour, we immediately feel in our
heart the unspeakable enchantment with which new proofs of
the power, the goodness, and the wisdom of God never fail to
penetrate us.</p>

<p>The region of final intentions, then, is for man’s imagination as
an atmosphere impregnated with religious ideas.</p>

<p>But after we have perceived, or had a glimpse of the phenomenon
in this aspect, we have still to study it in another relation, that is
to say, to seek for its efficient cause. <a id="p515" class="xxpn">[p515]</a></p>

<p>It is strange, but it sometimes happens, that after having
obtained the full knowledge of that cause, we find that it carries
with it so necessarily the effect which we had admired at first, that
we refuse to recognise in it longer the character of a final cause; and
we say: “I was very simple to believe that God had provided such
an arrangement with such a design; I see now that the cause
which I have discovered being given (and it is inevitable), this
arrangement must follow necessarily, apart from any pretended
providential intention.”</p>

<p>It is thus that defective and superficial science, with its scalpel
and its analyses, comes sometimes to destroy in our souls the religious
sentiment to which the simple aspect of nature had given rise.</p>

<p>This is the case frequently with the anatomist and the astronomer.
What a strange thing it is, exclaims the ignorant man,
that when an extraneous substance penetrates into a tissue, where
its presence does great injury, an inflammation and a suppuration
take place, which tend to expel it! No, says the anatomist, there
is nothing intentional in that expulsion. It is a <em class="e000I2">necessary</em> effect of
the suppuration; and the suppuration itself is a <em class="e000I2">necessary</em> effect of
the presence of an extraneous substance in our tissues. If you
wish it, I shall explain to you the mechanism, and you will
acknowledge yourself that the effect follows the cause, but that
the cause has not been arranged intentionally to produce that effect,
since it is itself the necessary effect of an anterior cause.</p>

<p>How I admire, says the ignorant man, the foresight of God, who
has willed that the rain should not descend on the soil in a sheet,
but should fall in drops, as if it came from the gardener’s watering-pot!
Were it not so, vegetation would be impossible. You throw
away your admiration, answers the learned naturalist; the cloud
is not a sheet of water; if it were, it could not be supported by the
atmosphere. It is a collection of microscopic vesicles, or minute
bladders like soap-bubbles. When their density increases, or when
they burst by compression, these thousands of millions of infinitesimal
drops fall, growing larger in their descent by the vapour of
the water which they precipitate, etc. If vegetation is benefited
in consequence, it is by accident; but we must not think that the
Creator amuses himself in sending us down water through the
sieve of a monster watering-pot.</p>

<p>Ignorance, we must confess, very often imparts a certain plausibility
to science, when the connexion of causes and effects is
regarded in this way, by attributing a phenomenon to a final intention
which does not exist, and which is dissipated before the light
of superior knowledge. <a id="p516" class="xxpn">[p516]</a></p>

<p>Thus, in former days, before men had any knowledge of electricity,
they were frightened by the noise of thunder, being able
to recognise in that astounding voice, bellowing amid the storm,
nothing less than a manifestation of Divine wrath. This is an association
of ideas which, like many others, has disappeared before the
progress of physical science. Man is so constituted, that when
a phenomenon affects him, he searches for the cause of it; and if he
finds out that cause, he gives it a name. Then he sets himself to
find out the cause of that cause, and so he goes on until he can
mount no higher, when he stops, and exclaims, “<em class="e000I2">It is God; it is
the will of God</em>.” This is his <em class="e000I2">ultima ratio</em>. He is arrested, however,
only for the moment. Science advances, and soon this
second, third, or fourth cause, which had remained unperceived, is
revealed to his eyes. Then science says, This effect is not due, as
we believed, to the immediate will of God, but to that natural
cause which I have just discovered. And man, after having taken
possession of this discovery, after having gained this step in the
region of science, finds himself, so to speak, one step farther
removed from the region of Faith, and again asks, What is the
cause of that cause? And not finding it, he persists in the ever-recurring
explanation, “It is the will of God.” And so he proceeds
onwards for indefinite ages, through a countless succession
of scientific revelations and exercises of faith.</p>

<p>This procedure on the part of mankind must appear to superficial
minds to be destructive of every religious idea; for is the
result of it not this, that as science advances, God recedes? Do
we not see clearly that the domain of final intentions is narrowed
in proportion as the domain of natural causes is enlarged?</p>

<p>Unhappy are they who give to this fine problem so narrow a
solution. No, it is not true that as science advances, the idea of
God recedes. On the contrary, what is true is that, as our intelligence
increases, this idea is enlarged, and broadened, and elevated.
When we discover a natural cause for what we had imagined an
immediate, spontaneous, supernatural act of the Divine will, are
we to conclude that that will is absent or indifferent? No, indeed;
all that it proves is, that that will acts by processes different from
those which it had pleased us to imagine. All that it proves is,
that the phenomenon which we regarded as an accident in creation
occupies its place in the universal frame; and that everything,
even the most special effects, have been foreseen from all eternity
by the divine prescience. What! is the idea which we form of
the power of God lessened when we come to see that each of the
countless results which we discover, or which escape our
<a id="p517" class="xxpn">[p517]</a> investigations, not only has its natural cause, but is bound up in an
infinite circle of causes; so that there is not a detail of movement,
of force, of form, of life, which is not the product of the great
whole, or which can be explained apart from that whole.</p>

<p>But why this dissertation, which is foreign, as it would seem, to
the main object of our inquiries? The phenomena of the social
economy have likewise their efficient cause, and their providential
intention. In this department, as in natural science, as in
anatomy, or in astronomy, men have frequently denied the final
cause precisely because the efficient cause assumes the character
of an absolute necessity.</p>

<p>The social world abounds in harmonies, of which we can form no
adequate or complete conception until the mind has remounted to
causes, in order to seek their explanation, and descended to effects,
to discover the destination of the phenomena.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="FN_32" href="#FNa_32">32</a> Adds! The subject had then intrinsic value, anterior to the bestowal of labour
upon it. That could only come from nature. The action of nature is not then
<em class="e000I2">gratuitous</em>, according to this showing; but in that case, who can have the audacity
to exact payment for this portion of <em class="e000I2">superhuman</em> value?</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="FN_33" href="#FNa_33">33</a> The French Economists translate our word <em class="e000I2">consumption</em> by consommation.—<em class="e00S02">Translator.</em></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="FN_34" href="#FNa_34">34</a> It is because, in a state of freedom, efforts compete with each other that they
obtain this remuneration nearly in proportion to their intensity. But, I repeat,
this proportionality is not inherent in the notion of value.
</p>
<p>
It is a proof that where this competition does not exist the proportionality
ceases. In that case we discover no relation between divers kinds of labour and
their remuneration.
</p>
<p>
The absence of competition may result from the nature of things or from human
perversity.
</p>
<p>
If it arises from the nature of things, we shall see a very small amount of labour
give rise to great <em class="e000I2">value</em>, and no one have reason to complain. Such is the case of
the man who finds a diamond. Such is the case of Rubini, of Malibran, of Taglioni,
of a fashionable tailor, of the proprietor of the Clos-Vougeot, etc., etc. Circumstances
have put them in possession of rare means of rendering service; they have
no rivals, and exact a high price. <em class="e000I2">The service being, from its very nature, of excessive
rarity</em>, shows that it is not essential to the well-being and progress of mankind. It
is an object of luxury, of vanity, which wealthy people are enabled to procure. Is
it not natural that a man, before indulging in such satisfactions, should wait until
he finds himself in a situation to provide for wants which are more imperious and
more reasonable?
</p>
<p>
If competition is absent in consequence of some human intervention, the same
effects are produced, but with this enormous difference, that they have been produced
where they ought not. In that case we see a comparatively small amount of
labour give rise to great value; but how? By forcibly interdicting that competition
the effect of which is to proportion remuneration to services. Then, just as Rubini
might say to a <em class="e000I2">dilettante</em>. “You must pay me handsomely, or I don’t sing this
evening,”—presuming on being able to render a service which no one else can
render,—in the same way a butcher, a baker, a landlord, a banker, may say, “I
must have an extravagant price, or you shall have none of my corn, my bread, my
meat, my gold; and I have adopted precautions, I shall employ force, to prevent
you being able to provide yourself elsewhere, and to make sure that no one shall
render you services analogous to mine.”
</p>
<p>
People who assimilate artificial to what they call natural monopolies, because
they have this in common, that they enhance the value of labour, such people, I
say, are both blind and superficial.
</p>
<p>
Artificial monopoly is nothing else than spoliation. It produces evils which,
apart from it, did not exist. It inflicts privations on a considerable portion of
society, frequently as regards commodities of primary necessity. Moreover, it gives
rise to irritation, hatreds, reprisals,—all the fruits of injustice.
</p>
<p>
Natural advantages do no harm to mankind. At most we can say that they
merely exhibit pre-existent evils, imputable to no one. It may be regretted, perhaps,
that tokay is not as cheap and as abundant as <em class="e000I2">vin ordinaire</em>. But that is not
a social evil; it is one imposed on us by nature.
</p>
<p>
Between natural and artificial monopolies, then, there is this essential difference:
</p>
<p>
The one is the effect of scarcity, pre-existent and inevitable.
</p>
<p>
The other is the effect of a scarcity which is factitious and unnatural.
</p>
<p>
In the first case, it is not the absence of competition which creates the scarcity;
it is the scarcity which explains the absence of competition. Society would be
puerile were it to complain and torment itself because there is in the world only
one Jenny Lind, one Clos-Vougeot, one Regent.
</p>
<p>
In the second case it is very different. It is not on account of a providential
scarcity that competition becomes impossible, but because force has repressed and
put down competition that there is created among men a scarcity which ought not
to have existed.—(<em class="e000I2">Note extracted from MSS. left by the Author.</em>)</p></div>

<p>
<em class="e000I2">Accumulation</em> is a circumstance of no account in Political Economy.
</p>
<p>
Let the satisfaction be immediate or delayed, let it be adjourned or follow instantly
on the effort,—in what respect does this change the nature of things?
</p>
<p>
I choose to make a sacrifice to enjoy the pleasure of hearing a fine voice. I go
to the theatre, and pay for my entertainment—the satisfaction is immediate. I
devote my money to the purchase of a basket of strawberries, and I can delay my
satisfaction till to-morrow—that is all.
</p>
<p>
It may be said that the strawberries constitute wealth, because I can exchange
them. True. Whilst the effort has been made and the satisfaction is delayed,
wealth subsists. It is satisfaction which destroys wealth. When the strawberries
been eaten the satisfaction will be on a level with that which I derived from
hearing Alboni.

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="FN_47" href="#FNa_47">47</a> The Earl of Lauderdale, from adopting the false principle which the author
here exposes, fell into the same error, maintaining that “<em class="e000I2">an increase of riches</em>, when
arising from alterations in the quantity of commodities, is always a proof of the
immediate <em class="e000I2">diminution of wealth</em>,” and that a diminution of riches is evidence of an
immediate increase of wealth; and that “in proportion as the <em class="e000I2">riches</em> of individuals
are increased by an augmentation of the <em class="e000I2">value</em> of any commodity, the wealth of the
nation is generally diminished; and in proportion as the mass of individual <em class="e000I2">riches</em>
is diminished by the diminution of the <em class="e000I2">value</em> of the commodity, the national opulence
is generally increased.” This melancholy paradox Lord Lauderdale maintained
stoutly in a set treatise. See <em class="e000I2">Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Public
Wealth by the Earl of Lauderdale</em>. Edition 1804, p. 50. Mr Ricardo has given an

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="FN_61" href="#FNa_61">61</a> On the subject of Rent, and the constituent elements of the Value of Land,
Bastiat would seem to have adopted, though perhaps unconsciously, the theory of
Mr Carey, in his able and original work on <em class="e000I2">The Principles of Political Economy</em>
(Philadelphia, 1837-38). Practically, no doubt, Mr Carey’s view of the subject to a
great extent holds true. If we take into account all the labour and capital laid out
in permanent ameliorations upon a field or a farm, from its first clearance to the
present moment, it may be true that there is scarcely any land now under cultivation
which is worth what it cost; and that the Rent yielded by such land, consequently,
resolves itself into the remuneration of anterior labour. But the sweeping
assertion of Bastiat, that “land which has not been subjected, directly or indirectly,
to human action is everywhere destitute of value,” is certainly not correct as a
“matter of fact;” for from the spot where I am now writing, I can see thousands
of acres which have never since the creation had a spade, or a plough, or a human
hand applied to them, which nevertheless do yield a Rent—a small rent, a shilling,
a penny an acre, it may be—but a return which can by no process of analysis be
resolved into the remuneration of anterior labour or capital. With regard to such
land, the question of rent or no rent would seem to depend on the current and usual
rate of profits.
</p>
<p>
Land in its natural state, and without cultivation, is capable of producing grass
for the food of cattle, and other products capable of rendering service to man.
Suppose, for example, that the agriculture of a country has reached the least productive
corn-land, which yields a return of £120 for each £100 of capital employed
in its cultivation, and that much of the remaining land is incapable of cultivation,—a
tract of moorland, or rough pasture, for instance, like some parts of the Highlands
of Scotland. Whether such land will or will not yield a rent must depend on
whether the return, in sheep, cattle, copsewood, or other produce, after replacing
the capital employed, exceeds or falls short of 20 per cent.
</p>
<p>
Suppose that a person possessed of a capital equal to £100, instead of applying
that capital to the cultivation of the least productive corn-land, with a return equal
to £120, employs his £100 in purchasing, tending, and bringing to market 100 sheep,—if
the annual produce and increase of his flock, over and above his necessary outgoings,
amounts only to 10 per cent. on his capital, of course he will find the rearing
of sheep unprofitable, and give up the trade. He can in that case pay no rent, for
his return is not equal to even the ordinary profits. But if the increase of his flock,
over and above his outgoings, amounts to 30 per cent. on the capital employed, then
the land to which we refer will yield a rent equal to 10 per cent. on that capital.
Whether this shall be the rent of 10, of 50, or 100, or 1000 acres of land, depends
entirely on how much land is required to feed 100 sheep; the greater the extent of
land, the less will be the rent of each acre; it may be a pound, or a shilling, or a
penny an acre; still every acre, and every part of every acre, will yield a <em class="e000I2">rent</em>.
Nor does the question of rent or no rent depend on the amount of the capital employed;
for if a capital of £100 employed on 10,000 acres of land yields a clear
return of £130 when profits are at 20 per cent., the surplus £10 clearly constitutes
rent. Rent depends on the ratio of the product to the capital employed, and if that
product, or its value, exceed the capital, or its value, by more than the ordinary
rate of profits, a rent, greater or less in amount, according to the value of the capital
and the extent of surface over which that capital is spread, will be yielded by every
inch of land capable of giving nourishment to a blade of grass.
</p>
<p>
On a searching analysis of rent, then, we always find a <em class="e000I2">residuum</em> which cannot be
resolved into the remuneration of anterior labour or capital; and as the value of
land in its natural and uncultivated state depends on the amount of this residuum,
or rent, if that value is to be brought within the limits of Bastiat’s theory, we must
apply to it the same principle which he applied (Chap. V., pp. 139-141 <em class="e000I2">ante</em>) to the
case of a diamond found by accident, and resolve it, not into service rendered by
undergoing labour, or <em class="e000I2">making an effort</em>, for another, but into service rendered by
<em class="e000I2">saving</em> another from undergoing the labour or making the effort for himself. Bastiat
seems to have felt this as he approached the conclusion of the present chapter. (See
<em class="e000I2">post</em>, p. 282.)
</p>
<p>
In this part of his work, Bastiat, in his desire to refute the fallacies of the
Socialists and Communists on the subject of property, seems to have gone beyond
the proper domain of Political Economy; for in strictness it is not the business of
that science to vindicate the institution of property, or to explain its origin. It is
enough for the Economist that property <em class="e000I2">exists</em>, and all that he is concerned to do is
to explain the laws which regulate the production, distribution, and consumption of
wealth.—<em class="e00S02">Translator.</em></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="FN_73" href="#FNa_73">73</a> Of these intended developments none, unfortunately, exist; but we may be
permitted to notice, briefly, the two principal consequences of the state of matters
supposed by the author.
</p>
<p>
1. Two fields, the one cultivated, A, the other uncultivated, B, being supposed of
identical quality, the amount of labour formerly devoted to the clearance of A is
assumed as the necessary measure of the amount of labour required for the clearance
of B. We may even say that, on account of our now superior knowledge of agriculture,
of our implements, of our improved means of communication, etc., a <em class="e000I2">less</em>
amount of labour would now be necessary to bring B into cultivation than was
formerly required in the case of A. If land had value in itself, A would be worth
all that it cost to bring it into culture, <em class="e000I2">plus something additional for its natural productive
powers</em>; that is to say, much more than the sum now required to bring B into
the same state. Now it is just the reverse. The field A is worth less since we
buy it rather than bring B into cultivation. In purchasing A, then, we pay nothing
for the natural productive powers, since the price does not even compensate the
original cost of bringing it into cultivation.
</p>
<p>
2. If the field A produces 1000 measures of corn, the field B when cultivated
must be supposed to produce the same quantity. The reason why A was formerly
cultivated was, that formerly 1000 measures of corn amply remunerated all the
labour required both for its original clearance and its annual cultivation. The
reason why B is not cultivated is, that now 1000 measures of corn would not
remunerate the same amount of labour, or even a less amount, as we have just
before remarked.
</p>
<p>
And what does this show? Evidently that the value of human labour has risen
in relation to corn; that a day’s labour is worth more wages estimated in corn. In
other words, corn is obtained with less effort, and is exchanged for a less amount of
labour; and the theory of <em class="e000I2">the progressive dearness of the means of subsistence is
erroneous</em>.—<em class="e00S02">Editor.</em></p></div>

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="FN_86" href="#FNa_86">86</a> Sir James Steuart of Coltness, whose <em class="e000I2">Inquiry into the
Principles of Political Economy</em> was published in 1767, nine years
before the appearance of Adam Smith’s great work, takes the very
same view of the principle of population which Malthus, thirty years
afterwards, more formally enunciated. “The generative faculty,” says
Sir James Steuart, “resembles a spring loaded with a weight, which
always exerts itself in proportion to the diminution of resistance.
When food has remained some time without augmentation or diminution,
generation will carry numbers as high as possible; if, then, food
come to be diminished, the spring is overpowered, the force of it
becomes less than nothing, inhabitants will diminish, at least
in proportion to the overcharge. If, on the other hand, food be
increased, the spring will begin to exert itself in proportion as the
resistance diminishes, people will begin to be better fed, they will
multiply, and, in proportion as they increase in numbers, the food
will become scarce again.”—<em class="e00S02">Translator.</em></p></div>

form, the land is let for a fixed rent, payable in money annually.
In the other, it is let under the condition of the produce being
divided between the proprietor and the cultivator. It is to the first
of these two modes of leasing land that we give more particularly
the name of <em class="e000I2">fermage</em>. The other is generally designated in France
as <em class="e000I2">métayage</em>.” (<em class="e000I2">Dictionnaire de l’Économie Politique</em>, tome i. p.

<p class="fnhead">XVII. PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SERVICES</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="FN_94" href="#FNa_94">94</a> “The moment this value is handed over by the taxpayer,
it is lost to him; the moment it is consumed by the Government, it
is lost to everybody, and does not return to society.”—<em class="e00S02">J. B.
Say</em>, <em class="e000I2">Traité d’Économie Politique</em>, liv. iii. chap 9.
</p>
<p>
Unquestionably; but society gains in return the service which is rendered to it—security,
for example. Moreover, Say returns to the correct doctrine almost immediately
afterwards, when he says,—“To levy a tax is to do a wrong to society—a
wrong which is compensated by no advantage, <em class="e000I2">when no service is rendered to society
in exchange</em>.”—<em class="e000I2">Ibid.</em></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="FN_95" href="#FNa_95">95</a> “Public contributions, even when they are consented
to by the nation, are a violation of property, seeing they can be
levied only on values which have been produced by the land, capital,
and industry of individuals. Thus, <em class="e000I2">whenever they exceed the amount
indispensable for the preservation of society</em>, we must regard them
as spoliation.”—<em class="e00S02">J. B. Say.</em> <em class="e000I2">Traité d’Économie Politique</em>,
liv. iii. chap. 9.
</p>
<p>
Here, again, the subsequent qualification corrects the too absolute
judgment previously pronounced. The doctrine that <em class="e000I2">services are
exchanged for services</em>, simplifies much both the problem and its
solution.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="FN_97" href="#FNa_97">97</a> The effects of such a transformation are strikingly
exemplified in an instance given by M. d’Hautpoul, the Minister of
War:—“Each soldier,” he says, “receives 16 centimes a day for his
maintenance. The Government takes these 16 centimes, and undertakes
to support him. The consequence is that all have the same rations,
and of the same kind, whether it suit them or not. One has too much
bread, and throws it away. Another has not enough of butcher’s meat,
and so on. We have, therefore, made an experiment. We leave to the
soldiers the free disposal of these 16 centimes, and we are happy
to find that this has been attended with a great improvement in
their condition. Each now consults his own tastes and likings, and
studies the market prices of what they want to purchase. Generally
they have, of their own accord, substituted a portion of butcher’s
meat for bread. In some instances they buy more bread, in others more
meat, in others more vegetables, in others more fish. Their health is
improved; they are better pleased; and the State is relieved from a
great responsibility.”
</p>
<p>
The reader will understand that it is not as bearing on military
affairs that I cite this experiment. I refer to it as calculated to
illustrate a radical difference between public and private service,
between official regulations and liberty. Would it be better for the
State to take from us our means of support, and undertake to feed
us, or to leave us both our means of support and the care of feeding
ourselves? The same question may be asked with reference to all our
wants.</p></div>

because I believe that it is under the
direction of a superior impulse, because, Providence being unable
to act in the social order except through the intervention of
men’s interests and men’s wills, it is impossible that the natural
resulting force of these interests, the common tendency of these
wills, should be towards ultimate evil; for then we must conclude
that it is not only man, or the human race, which proceeds onward
towards error; but that God himself, being powerless or malevolent,
urges on to evil His abortive creation. We believe, then, in liberty,
because we believe in universal harmony, because we believe in God.
Proclaiming in the name of faith, and formulating in the name of
science, the Divine laws of the moral movement, living and pliant
as these laws are, we spurn the narrow, sinister, unbending, and
unalterable institutions which the blind leaders of the ignorant
would substitute for this admirable mechanism. It would be absurd in
the atheist to say, <em class="e000I2">laissez faire le hasard!</em>—seek not to control
chance, or blind destiny. But, as believers, we have a right to say,
seek not to control the order and justice of God—seek not to control
the free action of the sovereign and infallible mover of all, or of
that machinery of transmission which we call the human initiative.
Liberty thus understood is no longer the anarchical deification of
individualism. What we adore is above and beyond man who struggles;
it is God who leads him.
</p>
<p>
We acknowledge, indeed, that man may err; yes, by the whole interval
which separates a truth realized and established from one which
is merely guessed at or suspected. But since man’s nature is to
seek, his destiny is to find. Truth, be it observed, has harmonious
relations, necessary affinities, not only with the constitution of
the understanding and the instincts of the heart, but also with the
whole physical and moral conditions of our existence; so that even
when we fail to grasp it as <em class="e000I2">absolute truth</em>, even when it fails to
recommend itself to our innate sympathies as <em class="e000I2">just</em>, or to our ideal
aspirations as <em class="e000I2">beautiful</em>, it, nevertheless, at length contrives
to find acceptance in its practical and unobjectionable aspect as
<em class="e000I2">useful</em>.
</p>
<p>
Liberty, we know, may lead to evil. But evil has itself its mission.
Assuredly God has not thrown it across our path as a stumbling-block.
He has placed it, as it were, on each side of that path as a
warning,—as a means of keeping us in the right road, or bringing us
back to it.
</p>
<p>
Man’s will and inclinations, like inert molecules, have their law
of gravitation. But, whilst things inanimate obey blindly their
pre-existent and inevitable tendencies, in the case of beings indued
with free will, the force of attraction and repulsion does not
precede action; it springs from the voluntary determination which
it seems to be waiting for, it is developed by the very act itself,
and it reacts for or against the agent, by a progressive exertion of
co-operation or resistance, which we term recompense or chastisement,
pleasure or pain. If the direction of the will coincides with that
of the general laws, if the act is <em class="e000I2">good</em>, happiness is the result.
If it takes an opposite direction, if it is <em class="e000I2">bad</em>, something opposes
or repels it; error gives rise to suffering, which is its remedy
and its end. Thus, Evil is constantly opposed by Evil, and Good as
constantly gives rise to Good. And we venture to say that, when seen
from a higher point of view, the errors of free will are limited to
certain oscillations, of a determinate extent, around a superior and
necessary orbit; all persistent resistance, which would force this
limit, tending only to destroy itself, without at all succeeding in
disturbing the order of the sphere in which it moves.
</p>
<p>
This reactive force of co-operation or repulsion, which, by means
of recompense and suffering, governs the orbit, at once voluntary
and necessary, of the human race, this <em class="e000I2">law of gravitation of free
beings</em> (of which Evil is only a necessary part) is distinguished by
the terms Responsibility and Solidarity; the one brings back upon
the individual; the other reflects and sends back on the social body
the good or bad consequences of the act; the one applies to man as
a solitary and self-governing individual; the other envelops him
in an inevitable community of good and evil as a partial element,
a dependent member, of a collective and imperishable being—man.
<em class="e000I2">Responsibility</em> is the sanction of individual liberty, the
foundation of the <em class="e000I2">rights</em> of man. <em class="e000I2">Solidarity</em> is the evidence of
his social subordination, and his principle of duty. . .&#160;.

<p class="fnhead">XXV. RELATIONS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY WITH MORALS, WITH POLITICS,
WITH LEGISLATION</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="FN_116" href="#FNa_116">116</a> The author has unfortunately left nothing on the subject
of the four chapters with which he appears (<em class="e000I2">see ante</em>, p. 30) to
have intended to conclude the present work, except the following
introduction to his projected chapter on the Relations of Political
Economy with Religion.
</p>
<p>
The line which separates the field of Political Economy from the
wider domains of Morals, Politics, and Legislation is perhaps by
no writer more accurately marked than by Mr Senior in the
admirable introduction to his article “Political Economy” in the
<em class="e000I2">Encyclop. Metropolitana</em>.
</p>
<p>
“The questions, to what extent and under what circumstances the
possession of wealth is, on the whole, beneficial or injurious to
its possessor, or to the society of which he is a member? what
distribution of wealth is most desirable in each different state
of society? and what are the means by which any given country can
facilitate such a distribution?—all these are questions of great
interest and difficulty, but no more form part of the science of
Political Economy, in the sense in which we use that term, than
Navigation forms part of the science of Astronomy. The principles
supplied by Political Economy are indeed necessary elements in their
solution, but they are not the only or even the most important
elements. The writer who pursues such investigations is, in fact,
engaged on the great science of Legislation; a science which requires
a knowledge of the general principles supplied by Political Economy,
but differs from it essentially in its subject, its premises, and
its conclusions. The subject of legislation is not wealth, but
human welfare. Its premises are drawn from an infinite variety of
phenomena, supported by evidence of every degree of strength, and
authorizing conclusions deserving every degree of assent, from
perfect confidence to bare suspicion. And its expounder is enabled,
and even required, not merely to state certain general facts, but to
urge the adoption or rejection of actual measures or trains of action.
</p>
<p>
“On the other hand, the subject treated by the Political Economist,
using that term in the limited sense in which we apply it, is not
happiness, but wealth; his premises consist of a very few general
propositions, the result of observation or consciousness, and
scarcely requiring proof or even formal statement, which almost every
man, as soon as he hears them, admits as familiar to his thoughts, or
at least as included in his previous knowledge; and his inferences
are nearly as general, and, if he has reasoned correctly, as certain
as his premises. Those which relate to the nature and the production
of wealth are universally true; and though those which relate to the
distribution of wealth are liable to be affected by the peculiar
institutions of particular countries, in the cases, for instance, of
slavery, legal monopolies, or poor laws, the natural state of things
can be laid down as the general rule, and the anomalies produced
by particular disturbing causes can be afterwards accounted for.
But his conclusions, whatever be their generality and their truth,
do not authorize him in adding a single syllable of advice. That
privilege belongs to the writer or the statesman who has considered
all the causes which may promote or impede the general welfare of
those whom he addresses, not to the theorist who has considered only
one, though among the most important, of those causes. The business
of a Political Economist is neither to recommend nor to dissuade,
but to state general principles which it is fatal to neglect, but
neither advisable nor perhaps practicable to use as the sole, or
even the principal, guides in the actual conduct of affairs. In the
meantime, the duty of each individual writer is clear. Employed
as he is upon a science in which error, or even ignorance, may be
productive of such intense and such extensive mischief, he is bound,
like a juryman, to give deliverance true according to the evidence,
and to allow neither sympathy with indigence nor disgust at profusion
or at avarice, neither reverence for existing institutions nor
detestation of existing abuses—neither love of popularity nor of
paradox, nor of system, to deter him from stating what he believes
to be the facts, or from drawing from those facts what appear to
him to be the legitimate conclusions. To decide in each case how
far these conclusions are to be acted on belongs to the art of
government, an art to which Political Economy is only one of many
subservient sciences, which involves the consideration of motives,
of which the desire for wealth is only one among many, and aims at
objects to which the possession of wealth is only a subordinate
means.”—<em class="e00S02">Translator.</em></p></div>

 <li> If, as wealth increases, the number among whom it is to be divided increases more rapidly, absolute wealth may be greater, but individual wealth will be less, <a href="#p401">401</a>.</li>
 <li> Malthus has reduced the principle to the formula that population tends to keep on a level with the means of subsistence, <a href="#p402">402</a>.</li>
 <li> This principle not new; every writer on such subjects since Aristotle has proclaimed it, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> Enunciated by Sir James Steuart thirty years before the appearance of the Essay on Population, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em>, <em class="e000I2">note</em>.</li>
 <li> Nature has taken greater care of species than of individuals, in order to insure the perpetuity of races, <a href="#p402">402</a>.</li>
 <li> Instances of this in the vegetable kingdom, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em>;
 <ul><li>   and in animals whose life is of a type more akin to vegetables, <a href="#p402">402</a>, <a href="#p403">403</a>.</li></ul></li>
 <li> Advancing in scale of social life, means of reproduction bestowed with greater parsimony, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> In the human species, reproductive faculty less powerful than in any other, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> But, physically, man does not escape the law of a tendency to multiplication beyond the limits of space and nourishment, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> Difference between the physiological power of multiplying and actual multiplication, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> Malthus inquired in what period of time mankind would double, if space and food were unlimited, <a href="#p404">404</a>.</li>
 <li> But as this hypothesis is never realized, theoretical must be shorter than actual period, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> Different rates of increase in different countries according to estimate of M. Moreau de Jonnès, <a href="#p403">403</a>.</li>
 <li> Such differences not the result of physiological causes, but of external obstacles, <a href="#p404">404</a>.</li>
 <li> New sources of local wealth lead invariably to increase of population, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> Objections made to the theory of Malthus very illogical, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> Nor are the arguments against his geometrical progression more conclusive, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> Fixed on twenty-five years as the minimum period in which population may double itself, because this actually takes place in America, <a href="#p405">405</a>.</li>
 <li> Malthus merely asserts that it has a <em class="e000I2">tendency</em> to increase in a geometrical progression, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> That this virtual power of multiplication will be restrained is just what Malthus contends for, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> Restrained by preventive and repressive checks, <a href="#p406">406</a>.</li>
 <li> He was wrong in adopting the limit of twenty-five years, although it holds good in America, <a href="#p406">406</a>, <a href="#p407">407</a>.</li>

 <li> Law of limitation as regards man manifests itself by the double action of foresight and destruction, <a href="#p410">410</a>.</li>
 <li> The term moral restraint, used by Malthus, does not give us a just idea of the domain of foresight, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> Other obstacles besides fear of poverty aid the action of the law of limitation in its preventive shape, <a href="#p410">410</a>, <a href="#p411">411</a>.</li>

 <li> Man’s perfectibility an important element in resolving the problem of population, <a href="#p413">413</a>.</li>
 <li> Malthus, by neglecting this, has attributed less force to the preventive than to the repressive check, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> For the expression, “means of subsistence,” Say has substituted one more exact, namely, “means of existence,” <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>

<li><em class="e000I2">Wages.</em> Men are always in search of something fixed, <a href="#p352">352</a>.
 <ul><li> Hence the great desire for government offices, <a href="#p353">353</a>.</li>
 <li> Fixity favoured by two circumstances, <a href="#p354">354</a>.</li>
 <li> Illustrations drawn from the principle of fire insurance, <a href="#p354">354</a>-<a href="#p357">357</a>.</li>
 <li> Remuneration by wages has the principle of fixity, so much sought after, <a href="#p357">357</a>.</li>
 <li> Opinions of the Socialists on this subject controverted, <a href="#p357">357</a>, <a href="#p358">358</a>.</li>
 <li> Wages, their origin, form, and effects, <a href="#p358">358</a>.</li>
 <li> Labour may be remunerated either by share of its product or by fixed wages, <a href="#p359">359</a>.</li>
 <li> Dependence not caused by form of remuneration, but by precarious situation of labourer, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> No men worse off than fishermen and vine-dressers, though they have the benefits of association, <a href="#p359">359</a>, <a href="#p360">360</a>.</li>
 <li> Results of labour applied to the chase, fishing, or agriculture very uncertain, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> To obviate this, a fixed unconditional bargain preferred, <a href="#p360">360</a>.</li>
 <li> This is not to destroy, but improve, the principle of association, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> Risks appreciated by means of experimental statistics, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> Remuneration by share of produce characteristic of times of barbarism, <a href="#p361">361</a>.</li>
 <li> Fixity of remuneration a step of progress, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> Association not thereby dissolved, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> Capital and labour both take a share of risk till it can be estimated by experience, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> This state of things gives place to a bargain which ensure unity of direction and fixity of situation, <a href="#p362">362</a>.</li>
 <li> The capitalist may take risk, paying fixed wages, or labourer may take risk, paying a fixed interest—still there is association, <a href="#p362">362</a>, <a href="#p363">363</a>.</li>
 <li> Wages have nothing degrading in them any more than interest, <a href="#p363">363</a>.</li>
 <li> The one is the remuneration of present, the other of anterior labour, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> Such stipulations are the cause and the manifestation of progress, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> Socialist errors on this subject confuted, <a href="#p364">364</a>, <a href="#p365">365</a>.</li>
 <li> Friendly Societies admirable means of providing against sickness and old age, <a href="#p368">368</a>.</li>
 <li> Have conferred immense benefits on the working classes, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> <em class="e000I2">Caisses de Retraite</em>, Friendly Accumulation Societies, <a href="#p371">371</a>-<a href="#p378">378</a>.</li>
 <li> Anterior labour, or capital, must necessarily have more security than present labour, <a href="#p377">377</a>-<a href="#p379">379</a>.</li>
 <li> Future of the working classes—tendency to become capitalists, <a href="#p379">379</a>-<a href="#p383">383</a>.</li>
 <li> Progress of the working classes between 1750 and 1850, <a href="#p381">381</a>.</li>
 <li> Relations of the capitalist and labourer, <a href="#p383">383</a>.</li>
 <li> Erroneous notions on this subject most dangerous, <a href="#p384">384</a>.</li>
 <li> Falsest theories abroad, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> Due to M. de Sismondi and M. Buret, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> Labourer’s share of product has a tendency to increase as capital increases, <a href="#p385">385</a>.</li>
 <li> When exchange takes place between capital, or anterior labour, and present labour, it is not on the footing of their duration or intensity, but of their value, <a href="#p387">387</a>.</li>
 <li> Anterior labour has a general tendency to become depreciated, <a href="#p388">388</a>, <a href="#p389">389</a>.</li>
 <li> Presence of capital always beneficial to labourer, <a href="#p390">390</a>.</li>
 <li> Groundless outcry against tyranny of capital, <a href="#p391">391</a>, <a href="#p392">392</a>.</li></ul></li>

 <li> Not a fixed quantity, but progressive and expansive, <a href="#p079">79</a>, <a href="#p080">80</a>.</li>
 <li> Rousseau recognises their elasticity, <a href="#p081">81</a>.</li>
 <li> In isolation, wants exceed powers; in the social state, powers exceed wants, <a href="#p098">98</a>.</li>
 <li> Man has more wants than any other living being, <a href="#p099">99</a>.</li></ul></li>

<li><em class="e000I2">War.</em> Principal thing which imparts to nations their distinctive character is the manner in which they provide for their subsistence, <a href="#p454">454</a>.
 <ul><li> Labour, although little noticed by historians, held as important a place among the ancients as it does with us, <a href="#p457">457</a>.</li>
 <li> War, spoliation, marked difference in the character of a nation which lives by, <a href="#p458">458</a>.</li>
 <li> It presupposes production, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> Spoliation in the shape of war has its root in selfishness, <a href="#p459">459</a>.</li>
 <li> Personal interest gives rise to harmony, but there are disturbing causes, <a href="#p460">460</a>.</li>
 <li> Labour is in itself a good, independent of its results, but we do not desire it for its own sake, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> Man, being placed between two evils, want and labour, seeks to get rid of both, <a href="#p461">461</a>.</li>
 <li> Spoliation then presents itself as a solution of the problem, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
 <li> War a waste of human power, <em class="e000I2">ib.</em></li>
